=item Description

genome_name - becomes the name of the object
workspace_name - the name of the workspace it gets saved to.
source - Source of the file typically something like RefSeq or Ensembl
taxon_ws_name - where the reference taxons are : ReferenceTaxons
taxon_id - if defined, will try to link the Genome to the specified
    taxonomy id in lieu of performing the lookup during upload
release - Release or version number of the data
      per example Ensembl has numbered releases of all their data: Release 31
generate_ids_if_needed - If field used for feature id is not there,
      generate ids (default behavior is raising an exception)
genetic_code - Genetic code of organism. Overwrites determined GC from
      taxon object
scientific_name - will be used to set the scientific name of the genome
    and link to a taxon
generate_missing_genes - If the file has CDS or mRNA with no corresponding
    gene, generate a spoofed gene.
use_existing_assembly - Supply an existing assembly reference
