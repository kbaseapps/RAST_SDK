        "description":"Mycosporines (mycosporine-like amino acids [MAAs]) are a diverse family of UV-absorbing secondary\r\nmetabolites that serve as screens against high doses of UV radiation (UVR).  They are found in cyanobacteria, some eukaryotic algae, corals, and fungi. MAAs are water soluble and colorless\r\nand share a 5-dihydroxy, 5-hydroxymethyl, cyclohex-1, 2-ene ring, with a methoxy group at C-2. This core structure is substituted in C-3 with an amino compound (usually an amino acid or amino alcohol) to form oxomycosporines. Ketone replacement with a second amino compound defines the iminomycosporine group. MAAs present typical UV absorption spectra with a single, narrow, and strongly absorbing band that has a maximum around 310 nm for oxomycosporines and around 330 nm for simple iminomycosporines. These compounds\r\nprotect the cell by absorbing UVR and dissipating the energy as heat without generating reactive oxygen species. MAAs have found pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications for their ability to protect skin from UV-mediated damage. \r\nMAA biosynthesis starts from sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (SHP) in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle that is processed by demethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) synthase and O-methyltransferase (O-MT), respectively, to form 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG), the core structure of mycosporines, followed by addition of glycine to 4-DG to form mycosporine-glycine and further condensation of serine to yield shinorine.\r\n \r\n",

It most likely  phosphorylates mycosporine-glycine, as a means of activation to allow the addition of the L-serine to the activated cyclohexone core, with the concurrent formation of water, ADP, and Pi. This has to be regarded as a working hypothesis.\r\n\r\nMycT = co-ocures with MycABC and is predicted in this SS to be a sodium/serine symporter.\r\n\r\nWhile functionally analogous, Ava_3855 and NpF5597 are entirely distinct proteins in sequence, functional domain, and, likely, also in mechanism. The reaction catalyzed by Ava_3855 involves the activation of the serine carboxylate, adenylation, and loading by the adenylation domain, which activates the amino acid as aminoacyl-AMP. Subsequently, the activated amino acid is transferred to the 4-phosphopantetheine moiety of the thiolation domain (T-domain) or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain with the release of AMP. Ava_3855 thus functionally belongs together with many nonribosomal\r\npeptide synthetases (NRPSs).\r\n"],

The cvn is widely distributed in the genomes of Actinobacteria, indicating that it plays an important role in this group of bacterial species; however, the exact role of this regulatory system is hitherto poorly understood. In the present study, we generated null mutants for all 13 copies of the cvn operon distributed in the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and observed that the aerial mycelium formation and antibiotic production in a cvn1 mutant were markedly impaired. The cvn1 mutant formed aerial mycelium and produced actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin at remarkably low levels on solid medium containing 1-2% glucose and at high levels on medium containing 6-10% glucose. The same phenotype as this was observed with a cvnA1 mutant. Transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression of sigU encoding a vegetative sigma factor was upregulated in the cvn1 mutant. Overexpression of rsuA encoding the sigma (SigU) antagonist restored aerial mycelium formation and pigment production in the cvn1 mutant, suggesting that the developmental defect in the cvn1 mutant is based on the high expression level of sigU.\r\nPMID: 21237251 \r\n",

        "description":"Subsystem still under construction. It has been created by Andreas Weber, whose exquisite contribution we gratefully acknowledge; it is currently being curated by SvetaG.\r\n\r\nPhotorespiration (oxidative photosynthetic C2 cycle) is a salvage pathway for 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG), the product of the oxygenase activity of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), to the Calvin cycle intermediate phosphoglycerate. Photorespiration is a light-dependent process reminiscent of mitochondrial respiration regarding its gas exchange, because O2 is taken up and CO2 released (reviewed in Reumann and Weber, 2006).\r\n\r\nIn plants this pathway is highly compartmentalized and involves reactions in chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria (see diagram). The H2O2-producing enzyme glycolate oxidase, catalase, and several aminotransferases of the photorespiratory cycle are located in peroxisomes, with catalase representing the major constituent of the peroxisomal matrix in photosynthetic tissues.  Identification of all the enzymes involved in this process has recently been completed, but very little is known still about the metabolite transporters for the exchange of photorespiratory intermediates between the organelles involved, and about the regulation of this pathway (Reumann and Weber, 2006).  In brief, the photorespiratory reactions first continue in the chloroplast stroma by dephosphorylation of 2-PG catalyzed by phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP).  Glycolate diffuses into the matrix of peroxisomes, where it is oxidized to glyoxylate by glycolate  oxidase (GOX) concomitant with the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).  Glyoxylate is  transaminated by two aminotransferases, Ser:glyoxylate and Glu:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGT and GGT), which ideally cooperate at a 1:1 stoichiometry.  The resulting Gly is the substrate of two mitochondrial  enzymes: Glycine decarboxylase (GDC) decomposes the  amino acid to CO2, NH3, and NADH and transfers a C1 unit  to 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (THF). Serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) attaches this methylene unit to the  second Gly molecule to produce Ser. Serine diffuses back to leaf  peroxisomes, where the amino group is removed by SGT to  yield hydroxypyruvate, which is reduced by NADH provided  by peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (pMDH) to form  glycerate.  Stromal glycerate kinase (GLYK) catalyzes the  final phosphorylation step of the photorespiratory cycle to  produce the Calvin cycle intermediate 3-PGA (from Reumann and Weber, 2006). \r\n\r\nAUXILIARY ROLES:  Gln synthase and Fd-dependent Glu synthase (GOGAT) are included in this SS due to their function in re-assimilation of photorespiratory ammonia generated by Glycine decarboxylase;  pMDH provides reducing equivalents, imported into leaf peroxisomes in the form of malate.\r\n\r\nIn cyanobacteria photorespiratory 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism is not yet clear, but it appears that in these organisms phosphoglycolate is metabolized by the cooperative action of plant-like C2 cycle and the bacterial-type glycerate pathway (Eisenhut et al., 2006).

LIPI-1 is stably inserted at the same locus in genomes of pathogenic L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii.  It is missing from genomes of nonpathogenic L. innocua and L. welshimeri (apparently due to a deletion), and is corrupt in L. seeligeri.  LIPI-1 has G+C composition similar to that of listerial core genome, lacks obvious traces of mobility factors, and its insertion locus is devoid of usual integration signals, such as tRNAs, repeats, etc (however, 2 small ORFs distantly related to viral proteins are located at its extreme right end).  LIPI-1 appears ancient, acquired by common Listeria ancestor.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to extend this subsystem in order to identify related virulence factors in other microbial pathogens has revealed orthologs for the majority of Listeria proteins located within LIPI-1 in several Gram(+) pathogens - with a notable exception of ActA, which has no prokaryotic homologs.  Surface protein ActA is necessary and sufficient for Listeria�s unique actin-based motility within the cytoplasm of an infected cell.  ActA causes polymerization of host actin filaments at one pole of the bacterium into long tails that propel the bacteria through the cytoplasm. (Listeria and Shigella flexneri are the only two unrelated facultative intracellular pathogens which spread from cell to cell by using this mode of intracellular movement.  However, IcsA (VirG) surface protein in S. flexneri required for this motility has no sequence similarity with ActA.)   Evolutionary origin of ActA is not clear, but it contains functional domains that mimic the natural role of the mammalian Arp2/3 complex-activating proteins of the WASP/Scar family, involved in dynamic remodeling of actin cytoskeleton. \r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n 1 = full length pathogenicity island LIPI-1 is present in a genome\r\n 9 = Listeria species with LIPI-1 completely or partially deleted\r\n 2 = homolog of one or more proteins from LIPI-1 can be asserted in an organism other than Listeria\r\n-1 = no homologs of any LIPI-1 proteins are evident in a genome\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

        "description":"The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest known superfamily of secondary carriers found in the biosphere. It is ubiquitously distributed throughout virtually all currently recognized organismal phyla. This superfamily currently (2012) consists of 74 families, each of which is usually concerned with the transport of a certain type of substrate. Many of these families, defined phylogenetically, do not include even a single member that is functionally characterized. (PMID:22458847) \r\n\r\nE. coli K-12 contains 70 MFS transporters, 15 of which may be considered drug exporters, as they belong to families 2 and 3 (http://www.membranetransport.org/), which are composed of 12-TMS (transmembrane segment) and 14-TMS members, respectively, of drug/H+ antiporters (37, 130). Most of them, however, are free-standing transporters located in the IM and transport drugs from the cytosol to only the periplasm. Because most antimicrobial agents reach the cytosol usually by diffusion across the membrane bilayer, the pumped- out drug molecules have a good chance of reentering the cytosol through this free-diffusion process, and the transporters of this class are not expected to create high-level resistance (PMID: 25788514).\r\n\r\nFor this reason this Subsystem encodes only those MFS pumps, which (i) occur with their own periplasmic adaptor proteins and with OM channels (such as TolC) and presumably produce an efficient tripartite efflux system (PMID: 25788514) and (ii) are still uncharacterized.  Several characterized tripartite efflux systems of MFS family are encoded in separate Subsystems, for example, see: SS: \"Tripartite multidrug efflux systems (of MSF type) EmrKY-TolC and EmrAB-TolC\"\r\n\r\nTripartite efflux systems in Gram-negative bacteria are composed of:\r\n- an outer membrane factor (OMF) \r\n- and a periplasmic accessory protein (often called a membrane fusion protein)\r\n- an inner membrance pump (which can belong to one of several protein families: MFS, RND, or ABC).  \r\n\r\nNote, that ONLY tripartite efflux systems with inner membrance pumps of the MFS family are encoded in this SS.  The tripartite systems with inner membrance pumps of other types are encoded separately, for example, see the following Subsystems:\r\n\r\n- \"Tripartite multidrug efflux systems (of RND type) AcrAB-TolC and related transporters\"\r\n- \"Tripartite multidrug efflux systems (of RND type) MdtABC-TolC\"\r\n- \"Macrolide MacAB-TolC efflux pump transporter (of ABC type)\"\r\n- etc\r\n\r\n",

Glycopeptides, in contrast, do not inhibit an enzyme, but bind directly to D-alanine-D-alanine and prevent subsequent crosslinking by the transpeptidase.

Inactivation of MurA is dependent on the presence of the substrate UDP-GlcNAc [Marquardt94]. The antibiotic covalently binds to the active site nucleophile Cys115 of the enzyme [Marquardt94, Skarzynski96]. A C115D mutant is active, but resistant to fosfomycin [Kim96a]. Overexpression of MurA increases resistance to fosfomycin [Xu06d, Couce12]; it is the only chromosomally encoded protein whose overexpression yields fosfomycin resistance [Couce12]. A murA mutant with increased resistance to fosfomycin was identified [Venkateswaran72]; the temperature-sensitive phenotype of that mutant may be unrelated to the murA mutation [Brown95]. Novel inhibitors of MurA activity have been sought and investigated [Baum01, Barbosa02a, Francisco04, Bachelier06, Dunsmore08, Miller10]. MurA is also the primary physiological target of the nonnatural toxin bromoacetate [Desai10].\n\n\nDDL:    D-alanine--D-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.4)\nd-Cycloserine\n\nJ Proteome Res. 2014 Feb 7;13(2):1065-76. PMID: 24303782.\nMetabolomics analysis identifies d-Alanine-d-Alanine ligase as the primary lethal target of d-Cycloserine in mycobacteria.\nHalouska S1, Fenton RJ, Zinniel DK, Marshall DD, Barletta RG, Powers R.\nAbstract\nd-Cycloserine is an effective second line antibiotic used as a last resort to treat multi (MDR)- and extensively (XDR) drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis . d-Cycloserine interferes with the formation of peptidoglycan biosynthesis by competitive inhibition of alanine racemase (Alr) and d-alanine-d-alanine ligase (Ddl). Although the two enzymes are known to be inhibited, the in vivo lethal target is still unknown. Our NMR metabolomics work has revealed that Ddl is the primary target of DCS, as cell growth is inhibited when the production of d-alanyl-d-alanine is halted. It is shown that inhibition of Alr may contribute indirectly by lowering the levels of d-alanine, thus allowing DCS to outcompete d-alanine for Ddl binding. The NMR data also supports the possibility of a transamination reaction to produce d-alanine from pyruvate and glutamate, thereby bypassing Alr inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis results in a cascading effect on cellular metabolism as there is a shift toward the catabolic routes to compensate for accumulation of peptidoglycan precursors.\n"],

        "notes":["Quoted from PMID:21991261 -\r\n\r\n\"One strategy for bacterial adaptation is to self-encapsulate with matrix material, primarily composed of secreted extracellular polysaccharides. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  has the genetic capacity to produce at least three secreted polysaccharides; alginate, PSL, and PEL. These polysaccharides differ in chemical structure and in their biosynthetic mechanisms. Since alginate is often associated with chronic pulmonary infections, its biosynthetic pathway is the best characterized. However, alginate is only produced by a subset of P. aeruginosa strains. Most environmental and other clinical isolates are non-micoid and use either PEL or PSL as the primary matrix structural polysaccharide.  \r\n\r\nThe PEL gene cluster is involved in the production of a glucose-rich matrix material in P. aeruginosa strain PA14.  The PSL gene cluster is involved in the production of a mannose-rich matrix material in P. aeruginosa strain ZK2870.  Either carbohydrate-rich matrix appears to be sufficient for mature biofilm formation, and at least one of them is required for mature biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa strains PA14 and ZK2870.  Limited information is available on the biosynthesis of these polysaccharides (reviewed in PMID:21991261, PMID:25438014, PMID:22176658).  It was predicted (in PMID:21991261) that alginate and PEL share certain features, while PSL biosynthesis resembles the EPS/CPS capsular biosynthesis pathway of Escherichia coli, where the PSL pentameric subunits are assembled in association with an isoprenoid lipid carrier\"\r\n"],

        "notes":["SS under construction\r\n\r\nA large number of plant species (2,000) as well as some fungi and bacteria are known to be capable of producing cyanide (HCN). Bacteria exhibit a range of natural resistance to cyanide related in part to their ability to synthesize cyanide-detoxifying enzymes. The added ability to assimilate metabolites derived therefrom accounts further for the unusual capacity of some bacteria (e.g. from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB) to grow on CN as a provisionary nitrogen source (ref. 2)\r\n\r\nThe production of cyanide at levels of 200�300 microM is more than sufficient to inhibit most forms of aerobic respiration, catalysed by haem�copper oxidases (Cunningham and Williams, 1995).  Hence, cyanogenic microorganisms must possess mechanisms for dealing with the presence of cyanide.  Two possible strategies can be utilized. First, the toxic effects of cyanide could be avoided by the use of a branch of the respiratory chain that is tolerant to cyanide at physiological concentrations or an anaerobic energy-generating pathway could be used. Alternatively, some mechanism to detoxify the cyanide it has produced can be induced. The following enzymes can contribute to cyanide detoxification: rhodanase (Colnaghi et al., 1996; Cipollone et al., 2004), formate dehydrogenase, cyanide hydratase (not yet associated with any bacterial sequences), cyanide oxygenase ((CNO) Fernandez & Kunz, 2005).  The later is still poorly understood and was recently reported to be a complex of 4 enzymes - NADH oxidoreductase Nox (P1); NADH peroxidase (P2); cyanide dihydratase (CynD, P3); carbonic anhydrase (P4) (ref.2)\r\n\r\nThe proposed pathway of HCN degradation in P.fluorescens (ref.2):\r\n\r\nHCN + O2 + 2NADH + 2H+ --> [HCONH2] + H2O + 2NAD+\r\n        [HCONH2] + H2O --> HCO2H + NH3\r\n           HCO2H + NAD --> CO2 + NADH + H+\r\n______________________________________________\r\n  HCN + O2 + NADH + H+ --> CO2 + NH3 + NAD+\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem is based largely on the following publications:\r\n\r\n1.

        "description":"Remarkably, nearly all bacterial toxins associated with specific clinical conditions (toxinoses) are encoded by mobile genetic elements. Examples are the toxins responsible for diphtheria, anthrax, tetanus, botulism, cholera, toxic shock,  scarlet fever, exfoliative dermatitis, food poisoning, travelers diarrhea, shigella dysentery, necrotizing pneumonia, and  others. An interesting example of this phenomenon is the family of related staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPI) encoding superantigens (SAgs). These are 15�20 kb elements that occupy constant positions in the chromosomes of toxigenic strains, and are characterized by certain phage-related features, namely genes encoding integrases, helicases,  and terminases, and the presence of flanking direct repeats (Novick, 2003).  The majority carry endotoxin genes, but some seem to harbor other genes potentially conferring selective advantage, e.g. SaGIm encodes a homolog of a ferrichrome-binding subunit (FhuD) of an ABC transporter (Kuroda et al., 2001).  The prototype element for the entire group, SaPI1 of Staphylococcus aureus RN4282, located near tyrB, encodes Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1) plus two other SAgs, SEK and SEL (Ruzin et al., 2001).  Some members of the family are capable of specific interactions with certain phages leading to excision, amplification, and encapsidation.  Notably, some copies are located in the proximity of prophages.  \r\n\r\nWith these elements being very variable, we relied mostly on their specific integration sites (att) in the S. aureus genome for classification (see Table 1 - access via green \"Illustrations\" tab on top of this page).  For the published elements we tried to keep the names suggested in the original publication, for all others - names were projected in accordance with their att sites. \r\nNote, that if you view Subsystem spreadsheet with �show clusters� activated, the clustering of the first gene of each element (Integrase, columns 6,7) with one of the possible integration sites (columns 1-5) will reveal the element type.   There can be more than one element present per genome.   Also, in several strains only a degenerated integrase gene is be present at the att site (a scar from previous integration events??)\r\n",

        "description":"The T6SS is an important virulence mechanism in several Gram-negative pathogens. In Vibrio cholerae, a minimum of three gene clusters - one main cluster and two auxiliary clusters - are required to form a functional T6SS apparatus capable of conferring virulence toward eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts.\nThe T6SS shares similarity with the puncturing device of bacteriophages, which is used by these viruses to inject their DNA into bacterial target cells.\nBacteria use rapid contraction of a long sheath of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to deliver effectors into a target cell. The native contracted Vibrio cholerae sheath has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The sheath subunits, composed of tightly interacting proteins VipA and VipB, assemble into a six-start helix. The helix is stabilized by a core domain assembled from four &#946; strands donated by one VipA and two VipB molecules. The fold of inner and middle layers is conserved between T6SS and phage sheaths. However, the structure of the outer layer is distinct and suggests a mechanism of interaction of the bacterial sheath with an accessory ATPase, ClpV (tssH), that facilitates multiple rounds of effector delivery. \n",

The levels of SAMP-conjugates were altered by nitrogen-limitation and proteasomal gene knockout and spanned various functions including components of the Urm1 \r\npathway. LC-MS/MS-based collision-induced dissociation demonstrated isopeptide bonds between the C-terminal glycine of SAMP2 and the e-amino group of lysines from a number of protein targets.  The widespread distribution and diversity of pathways modified by SAMPylation suggest that this type of \r\nprotein conjugation is central to the archaeal lineage. \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nHumbard M.A. et al., 2010.

Most of the length of the TolA consists of low-complexity sequence that may differ in both length and composition from one species to another, complicating efforts to discriminate TolA (the most divergent gene in the tol-pal system) from paralogs such as TonB. TolA undergoes a conformational change in response to changes in the proton-motive force, and interacts with Pal in an energy-dependent manner. The C-terminal periplasmic domain of TolA also interacts with the N-terminal domain of TolB.\r\nThe Tol-Pal system is exploited by colicin and filamentous phage DNA to enter the cell. It is also implicated in pathogenesis in several bacterial species. \r\n\r\nThe homologous ExbB/ExbD/TonB protein complex, powers transport of siderophores and vitamin B12 across the bacterial outer membrane.\r\n",

PMID:20233304\r\nA lipoprotein modulates activity of the MtrAB two-component system to provide intrinsic multidrug resistance, cytokinetic control and cell wall homeostasis in Mycobacterium.\r\nNguyen HT1, Wolff KA, Cartabuke RH, Ogwang S, Nguyen L.\r\nAbstract\r\nThe MtrAB signal transduction system, which participates in multiple cellular processes related to growth and cell wall homeostasis, is the only two-component system known to be essential in Mycobacterium. In a screen for antibiotic resistance determinants in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we identified a multidrug-sensitive mutant with a transposon insertion in lpqB, the gene located immediately downstream of mtrA-mtrB. The lpqB mutant exhibited increased cell-cell aggregation and severe defects in surface motility and biofilm growth. lpqB cells displayed hyphal growth and polyploidism, reminiscent of the morphology of Streptomyces, a related group of filamentous Actinobacteria. Heterologous expression of M. tuberculosis LpqB restored wild-type characteristics to the lpqB mutant. LpqB interacts with the extracellular domain of MtrB, and influences MtrA phosphorylation and promoter activity of dnaA, an MtrA-regulated gene that affects cell division. Furthermore, in trans expression of the non-phosphorylated, inactive form of MtrA in wild-type M. smegmatis resulted in phenotypes similar to those of lpqB deletion, whereas expression of the constitutively active form of MtrA restored wild-type characteristics to the lpqB mutant. These results support a model in which LpqB, MtrB and MtrA form a three-component system that co-ordinates cytokinetic and cell wall homeostatic processes.\r\nPMID:20233304\r\n\r\n\r\nTrends Microbiol. 2006 Oct;14(10):444-9. PMID:16934981\r\nMtrAB-LpqB: a conserved three-component system in actinobacteria?\r\nHoskisson PA1, Hutchings MI.\r\nAbstract\r\nStreptomyces coelicolor is the model organism for the actinobacteria, a group of high-GC Gram-positive bacteria with members that are notable both for their industrial importance as antibiotic producers and for their pathogenicity. The S. coelicolor genome encodes a subgroup of sensor kinases that is genetically linked to lipoprotein genes, at least one of which functions as an accessory protein to its co-translated kinase. Another member of this subgroup, MtrB, is widely conserved in the actinobacteria, along with its presumed cognate response regulator MtrA and the lipoprotein LpqB. Here, we postulate a possible role for LpqB in the MtrAB signal transduction pathway. We discuss what is known about this pathway in the actinobacteria and offer insights into why an essential response regulator does not necessarily need its cognate sensor kinase for activation.\r\n\r\n",

        "description":"The bacABCDEF operon of B. subtilis is responsible for the biosynthesis of the nonribosomally synthesized dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin, composed of L-alanine and L-anticapsin. Bacilysin is an irreversible inactivator of the glutaminase domain of glucosamine synthetase. Catalyzes the reductive amination of the C2 ketone of tetrahydro-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (H4HPP), with L-Phe as an amino donor, to yield tetrahydrotyrosine (H4Tyr) diastereomer. D-Phe is not an effective amino donor. BacF associated to BacG converts 3E,7R- and 3Z,7R-ex-H2HPP to 2S,4R,7R- and 2S,4S,7R-H4Tyr, respectively. Given that bacilysin has the 2S,4S stereochemistry in its anticapsin moiety, it is likely that the 2S,4S-H4Tyr is the diastereomer used for the biosynthesis.\r\n\r\nBacA is an unusual prephenate decarboxylase that avoids the typical aromatization of the cyclohexadienol ring by protonating C(8) to produce an isomerized structure. BacB then catalyzes an allylic isomerization, generating a conjugated dienone with a 295 nm chromophore. Both the BacA and BacB products are regioisomers of H(2)HPP (dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate). The BacB product is then a substrate for the short chain reductase YwfH which catalyzes the conjugate addition of hydride at the C(4) olefinic terminus using NADH to yield the cyclohexenol-containing tetrahydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate H(4)HPP. In turn, this keto acid is a substrate for YwfG, which promotes transamination (with L-Phe as amino donor), to form tetrahydrotyrosine (H(4)Tyr), which has not previously been identified in B. subtilis but is a recognized building block in cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptides such as micropeptins and aeruginopeptins.\r\n",

        "description":"Many classes of antibiotics target various components of protein synthesis machinery, with the ribosome itself being a common target.  Some drugs interact with specific ribosomal components, e.g. 30S ribosomal subunit or 50S ribosomal subunit.  Others target the ribosomal complex in its entirety by stabilizing it and thus preventing further translation. \n\nThe bacterial 23S rRNA has peptidyl transferase activity (at the P site of the 50S subunit), which can be blocked by several classes of antibiotics: \n- Macrolide_lincosamide_streptogramin_ketolide_oxazolidinone (MLSKO)\n- Chloramphenicols_florfenicols\n- glycopeptide antibiotics\n\nThe 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit helps to stabilize the aminoacyl-tRNAs for pairing with the mRNA codons. Some antibiotics (aminoglycosides) that target the 16S rRNA lead to mRNA misreading as well as premature termination. Other antibiotics (tetracyclines) that target the 16S rRNA prevent incoming charged-tRNAs from binding to the ribosome's A-site, stopping elongation.\n\nSpecific methylation or point mutations in the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA of the small 30S subunit or 23S ribosomal RNA of the large 50S subunit can reduce antibiotic binding affinity at specific sites, conferring resistance to antibiotics.\n",

The cyt b (bc1) polypeptide with eight TM helices A-H is replaced in the b6 f complex by two smaller integral polypeptides (cyt b6 and subunit IV) consisting of helices A-D and E-G (Widger et al., 1984).  \r\n\r\n2. Cytochromes f and c1 are completely different in terms of both proteins sequence and structure, except for both being c-type cytochromes with the characteristic Cys-X-Y-Cys-His c-heme binding sequence motif.\r\n\r\n3.  While the four larger subunits of the b6 f complex have structural and/or functional similarity to that of bc1, the 3(4) small subunits are unique to the b6 f complex. \r\n\r\n4. There are one molecule each of chlorophyll a (Huang  et al., 1994) and beta-carotene (Zhang et al., 1999a) present in the b6 f complex (absent in bc1).\r\n\r\n5. Lipid content can be different, as there are 5 molecules per monomer of the unique lipid monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol present in the b6 f complex (Soriano et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nThe bc1 complex in plants is encoded in Subsystem: Respiratory complex III (cytochrome b-c1) in plants.

        "notes":["Observations, conjectures:\r\n\r\n1. Missing small subunits -\r\n Cytochrome b6-f complex of cyanobacteria is formed by four main relatively large subnits (PetA, PetB, PetC, and PetD) and several small hydrophobic 3.2-4.2 kDa polypeptides PetG, L, M, and N. In addition to these subunits, plant cyt b6/f complex contains PetH (PMID: 11483610). While orthologs of large conserved subunits are easily identifiable in a genome sequence, the small subunits are often overlooked during ORF calling due to their small size.  Hence, the absence of orthologs of small subunits in a genome does NOT imply nonfunctional cyt b6-f complex.\r\n\r\n2. PetC protein family -\r\nCyanobacteria come in two cytocrome b6-f flavors: some [variant code 1] contain a single Rieske iron sulfur protein (encoded by petC1 always cotranscribed with petA).  Others [variant code 2] contain from 2 to 4 additional Rieske proteins (encoded by genes petC2, petC3, etc., differing from petC1 to various degrees).  So far, association of PetC2 and PetC3 with functional cytocrome b6-f complex has been demonstrated formally only in Synechocystis PCC 6803, and merely inferred in other variant 2 species. \r\n\r\n3. A speculation/prediction:\r\nWhile biological significance of the presence of different Rieske proteins is not clear, I can�t help noting, that ALL �mono-PetC� species identified so far are strict photoautptrophs, while all (but one � see below) �multiple-PetC� species are capable of photoheterotrophic growth (inferior to photoautrophy in a life of a cyanobacterium).  Since cytochrome b6/f complex in cyanobacteria is an essential component of both the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer chain, can it be that substitution of the default �photoautotrophic� PetC1 Rieske protein for a different one in the cyt b6/f complex is a necessary requirement for activation of (photo)heterotrophic growth based solely on respiratory electron chain?  \r\n\r\nNostoc (Anabaena) sp. PCC 7120 � the only exception of this observation � is an interesting case in itself.  Comparative genomic analysis of central carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria (conducted earlier by Dr. Ivanova et al.) has detected consistent differences between obligate and facultative photoautotrophs in organization of glycolysis and TCA. Interestingly, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 was an exception in that study as well: it was the only photoautotrophic cyanobacterium with �photoheterotrophic� type of its central carbon metabolism.  \r\n\tIf this observation happens to be true, the presence of PetC protein family in a newly sequenced cyanobacterial genome along with specific features of central carbon metabolism could be used for prediction of its growth capabilities.\r\n"],

Here we have studied the evolutionary history of the M. tuberculosis Rv0986-8 virulence operon recently identified, through functional genomics approaches, as playing an important role in parasitism of host phagocytic cells. We showed that among actinobacteria, this operon is specific to the M. tuberculosis complex and to ancestral Mycobacterium prototuberculosis species. These data, together with phylogenetic reconstruction and other in silico analyses, provided strong evidence that this operon has been acquired horizontally by the ancestor of M. tuberculosis, before the recent evolutionary bottleneck that preceded the clonal-like evolution of the M. tuberculosis complex. Genomic signature profiling further suggested that the transfer was plasmid mediated and that the operon originated from a gamma-proteobacterium donor species. Our study points out for the first time the contribution of HGT to the emergence of M. tuberculosis and close relatives as major pathogens. In addition, our data underline the importance of deciphering gene transfer networks in M. tuberculosis in order to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms involved in mycobacterial virulence.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 16520338\r\n",

Summary below quotes this exquisite study -\r\n\r\nBacimethrin [see Figure under Illustrations tab above) is an analogue of the thiamin pyrimidine that exhibits antibiotic activity against a variety of yeast and bacteria (PMID:14066391) It's toxicity involves its conversion, by the endogenous thiamin biosynthetic enzymes, to 2&#8242;-methoxythiamin pyrophosphate, which inhibits a subset of the thiamin-dependent enzymes in Escherichia coli (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, transketolase, and deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase) (PMID:11527707). \r\n\r\nBcmA catalyzes the methylenetetrahydrofolate-dependent hydroxymethylation of cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP) to give 5-hydroxymethylcytidine 5&#8242;-monophosphate.  BcmB catalyzes the N-glycosyl bond cleavage of the latter compound to give 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.  It is in turn methylated by BcmC to give Bacimethrin. Bacimethrin is then pyrophosphorylated by BcmD (ThiD) to produce Bacimethrin pyrophosphate \r\n\r\nA putative thiaminase-I gene, bcmE, is located in the bacimethrin biosynthetic gene cluster. Thiaminases catalyze degradation of thiamin by replacement of the thiazole moiety with a wide range of nucleophiles (type I) or water (type II).  Its presence could suggest that BcmE might function as a resistance protein catalyzing the degradation of methoxythiamin.  To test this hypothesis, BcmE was incubated with thiamin or 2&#8242;-methoxythiamin as a possible substrate. Only thiamin was degraded by BcmE, hence BcmE and is not involved in protecting C. botulinum from the toxicity of methoxythiamin.  \r\nThis observation suggests that bacimethrin and thiaminase-I are elements of a coordinated antibiotic strategy in which degradation of environmental thiamin by secreted thiaminase-I makes target bacteria more sensitive to the toxicity of bacimethrin. Such a strategy highlights the complex chemical logic underlying the dynamics of microbial communities (PMID:24654570)\r\n\r\n",

Epub 2013 Jul 8.\r\nSalmonella Utilizes D-Glucosaminate via a Mannose Family Phosphotransferase System Permease and Associated Enzymes.\r\nMiller KA, Phillips RS, Mr�zek J, Hoover TR.\r\nAbstract\r\nSalmonella enterica is a globally significant bacterial food-borne pathogen that utilizes a variety of carbon sources. We report here that Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) uses d-glucosaminate (2-amino-2-deoxy-d-gluconic acid) as a carbon and nitrogen source via a previously uncharacterized mannose family phosphotransferase system (PTS) permease, and we designate the genes encoding the permease dgaABCD (d-glucosaminate PTS permease components EIIA, EIIB, EIIC, and EIID). Two other genes in the dga operon (dgaE and dgaF) were required for wild-type growth of S. Typhimurium with d-glucosaminate. Transcription of dgaABCDEF was dependent on RpoN (&#963;(54)) and an RpoN-dependent activator gene we designate dgaR. Introduction of a plasmid bearing dgaABCDEF under the control of the lac promoter into Escherichia coli strains DH5&#945;, BL21, and JM101 allowed these strains to grow on minimal medium containing d-glucosaminate as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. Biochemical and genetic data support a catabolic pathway in which d-glucosaminate, as it is transported across the cell membrane, is phosphorylated at the C-6 position by DgaABCD. DgaE converts the resulting d-glucosaminate-6-phosphate to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 6-phosphate (KDGP), which is subsequently cleaved by the aldolase DgaF to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. DgaF catalyzes the same reaction as that catalyzed by Eda, a KDGP aldolase in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and the two enzymes can substitute for each other in their respective pathways. Examination of the Integrated Microbial Genomes database revealed that orthologs of the dga genes are largely restricted to certain enteric bacteria and a few species in the phylum Firmicutes.\r\nPMID: 23836865\r\n",

        "notes":["See below (Under \"Variants\") the descriptions of the current variant codes.\r\nOld detailed variant codes were as follows:\r\n\r\nA. The first  digits in a variant code reflect the type of 5-aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis present in an organism:\r\n1***: 5-aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis via C5-pathway\r\n2***: 5-aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis via Shemin pathway\r\n3***: both pathways are present in the organism\r\n8***: both pathways are absent in the organism\r\n\r\nThe common precursor of all marcocyclic and linear tetrapyrroles, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), is synthesized by two alternative unrelated routes called the C5-pathway (Beale and Castelfranco 1973; Jahn et al. 1992) and the Shemin pathway (Shemin and Russell 1953).  The C5 pathway, which is found in most bacteria, archaea and plants, starts from the C5-skeleton of glutamate, ligated to tRNAGlu. Some alpha-proteobacteria, fungi, and animals synthesize 5-aminolevulinate via Shemin pathway by condensation of succinyl-CoA with glycine.  Coexistence of both pathways in a single organism is very rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Universal steps in biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles: condensation of 8 molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid to form Uroporphyrinogen III.   No variants detected so far -- hence, no representation in variant codes. However, HemD homologs are missing in quite a few species, including Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Caulobacter crescentus CB15, Rickettsiae, Leptospira interrogans, Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, Cytophaga hutchinsonii, etc.\r\n\r\nUroporphyrinogen III (UroIII) is the first cyclic tetrapyrrole intermediate in the pathway and is a precursor both to oxidized tetrapyrroles, such as haem and chlorophylls, and to reduced tetrapyrroles, such as sirohaem, vitamin B12 and haem d1.  \r\n\r\nC. Terminal steps of protoheme biosynthesis: Uroporphyrinogen III to Protoheme.\r\n\r\nVariations within these steps are encoded in the 2d and 3d digits of variant codes. The second digit  describes the type of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase present in a genome:\r\n*1**: CPOae,  oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3, HemF) catalyzes oxidative   decarboxylation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX with oxygen as the electron acceptor, \r\n*2**: CPOan, oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemN or/and HemZ),\r\n*3**: Both forms of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (aerobic and anaerobic) are present in an organism.\r\n*9**: Both forms of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (aerobic and anaerobic) are missing.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy: CPOan homologs seem to be present in many genomes where all other porphyrin biosynthetic genes are absent.\r\n\r\nThe 3d digit reflects the type of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO), catalyzing the penultimate step in heme biosynthsis:\r\n**1*: Organisms containing oxygen-dependent protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOae)\r\n**2*: Organisms containing oxygen-independent protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOan)\r\n**3*: Both forms of PPO, aerobic and anaerobic, are present in an organism (uncommon)\r\n**9*: Both known genes for protoporphyrinogen oxidase are missing\r\n\r\nAs with CPO, two forms of PPO exist: one oxygen-dependent and one oxygen-independent.  In bacteria where these two PPOs have been identified, the gene for the oxygen dependent form is hemY, and that for the oxygen-independent form is called hemG.  Unlike with CPO HemN and HemF, only a single form of PPO is generally found in a given cell.  Facultative organisms such as E. coli possess only HemG. HemG protein interacts with the cell�s respiratory chain to eliminate the reducing equivalents acquired by protoporphyrinogen oxidation. The oxygen-independent protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOan) present in many Gram-positive species (including Bacillus subtilis) is similar to the eukaryotic enzyme. HemY contains a flavin cofactor and utilizes molecular oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor (Hansson and Hederstedt 1994). \r\nHowever, hemG or hemY genes are not found in all heme-synthesizing prokaryotes. A recognizable PPO gene (hemG or hemY) is missing in roughly half of heme-synthesizing microorganisms.\r\n\r\nNote:  to further complicate things, an E. coli gene located within hem operon has also been named hemY.  However, it has no homology with B. subtilis hemY and its function is unknown.  Since it's homologs are clustered with hem genes in many genomes, the corresponding protein has been included in this Subsystem (abbreviated as EcHemY).\r\n\r\n\r\nD: The fourth digit shows the presence or absence of Siroheme Biosynthetic genes in a genome:\r\n\r\n***1:  all the necessary genes of siroheme biosynthesis are present in a genome\r\n***9:  all known genes of siroheme biosynthesis are absent\r\n***8:  siroheme biosynthesis can be asserted tentatively, but at least one of the required enzymes could not be detected, most often Precorrin-2 oxidase (missing gene??) \r\n\r\nBiosynthesis of siroheme  (branching off the heme biosynthetic pathway at the level of Uroporphyrinogen-III) has been included in this Subsystem because genes encoding it are often clustered with genes of heme biosynthesis.  Furthermore, UroIII methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107) catalyzing the first step in siroheme biosynthesis is often fused with UroIII synthase (EC 4.2.1.75) � one of the enzymes of heme biosynthetic pathway (its universal steps).  Interestingly, while in many Gram-Positive bacteria (Bacillus, Clostridia, Listeria, Fusobacteria, and other genera) the order of the two domains in fused protein is as follows: methyltransferase/synthase, but the order is reversed in Burkholderiaceae, indicating that this fusion has occurred independently at least twice in evolution. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, all the three steps of sirohaem biosynthesis  (methylation, oxidation, Fe-chelation) are catalyzed by a single protein, siroheme synthase, the product of the cysG gene (fusion again!) in most Siroheme-containing organisms.   Interestingly, in some Gram-Positive groups (Bacillus, Clostridia, Listeria) a \"short version\" of siroheme synthase is present, which contains  Precorrin-2 oxidase (EC 1.3.1.76) and Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.4) domeins, but not the C-terminal UroIII methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107) domein.  The reason for the strong tendency of all siroheme biosynthetic genes to be fused together is intriguing (see Forum posting for some ideas).  \r\n\r\nAnother puzzle:  the first step in synthesis of sirohaem, (as well as vitamin B12 and haem d1) is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of UroIII to form precorrin-2.  Surprisingly, UroIII methyltransferase is often present in organisms that lack any known genes encoding downstream steps in biosynthesis of these tertapyrroles.  \r\n\r\nThe iron-chelating siroheme is required for the six-electron transfer reactions during assimilatory nitrite or sulfite reduction (Raux et al. 2003) and CysG is often co-localizes with genes encoding nitrite or sulfite reductases.\r\n\r\nArchaea have NOT been looked into in detail yet - sorry.\r\n\r\nThis SS is further discussed in the Supplementary materials for the paper (Overbeek et al., 2005) at \r\nhttp://www.theseed.org/SubsystemStories/index.html\r\n\r\n"]},

Epub 2015 Nov 19.\r\nEmergence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanism MCR-1 in animals and human beings in China: a microbiological and molecular biological study.\r\nLiu YY, Wang Y, Walsh TR, Yi LX, Zhang R, Spencer J, et al\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nBACKGROUND:  Until now, polymyxin resistance has involved chromosomal mutations but has never been reported via horizontal gene transfer. During a routine surveillance project on antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from food animals in China, a major increase of colistin resistance was observed. When an E coli strain, SHP45, possessing colistin resistance that could be transferred to another strain, was isolated from a pig, we conducted further analysis of possible plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance. Herein, we report the emergence of the first plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance mechanism, MCR-1, in Enterobacteriaceae.\r\n\r\nMETHODS:  The mcr-1 gene in E coli strain SHP45 was identified by whole plasmid sequencing and subcloning. MCR-1 mechanistic studies were done with sequence comparisons, homology modelling, and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The prevalence of mcr-1 was investigated in E coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains collected from five provinces between April, 2011, and November, 2014. The ability of MCR-1 to confer polymyxin resistance in vivo was examined in a murine thigh model.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS: Polymyxin resistance was shown to be singularly due to the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene. The plasmid carrying mcr-1 was mobilised to an E coli recipient at a frequency of 10(-1) to 10(-3) cells per recipient cell by conjugation, and maintained in K pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In an in-vivo model, production of MCR-1 negated the efficacy of colistin. MCR-1 is a member of the phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family, with expression in E coli resulting in the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A. We observed mcr-1 carriage in E coli isolates collected from 78 (15%) of 523 samples of raw meat and 166 (21%) of 804 animals during 2011-14, and 16 (1%) of 1322 samples from inpatients with infection.\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION:  The emergence of MCR-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, polymyxins, by plasmid-mediated resistance. Although currently confined to China, MCR-1 is likely to emulate other global resistance mechanisms such as NDM-1. Our findings emphasise the urgent need for coordinated global action in the fight against pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\r\n"],

        "subsystem_id":"Siderophore_Aerobactin",
        "description":"Unlike many polypeptide siderophores, that are synthesized by various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), aerobactin is not a polypeptide, and it is produced via an NRPS-independent pathway catalyzed by two siderophore synthetase enzymes IucA and IucC (de Lorenzo et al., 1986).  Other siderophores produced by similar NRPS-independent pathways include rhizobactin 1021, achromobactin, vibrioferrin, alcaligin, and desferrioxamine E (reviewed by Challis, 2005).  Such siderophores are assembled from alternating dicarboxylic acid and diamine or amino alcohol building blocks (which are nevertheless derived from amino acids) linked by amide or ester bonds. \r\n\r\nAerobactin is a dihydroxamate comprising two molecules of N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxylysine and one molecule of citric acid.  This compound was first isolated from Enterobacter aerogenes (Gibson et al., 1969), which at the time was known as Aerobacter aerogenes, hence the name.  \r\n\r\nAerobactin biosynthesis\r\nAerobactin biosynthesis genes (iucABCD) can be either plasmid- or chromosome-borne, but they were first identified and cloned from plasmid pColV-K30 (de Lorenzo et al., 1986).  This cluster often includes the fifth gene (iutA) encoding the receptor protein.  Pioneering biochemical genetic studies in the 1980s by Neilands and co-workers established in detail the mechanism of aerobactin is biosynthesis in E.coli (de Lorenzo et al., 1986).  In addition to E. coli, the aerobactin pathway has been detected in many bacterial species including Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella arizona, Vibrio mimcus, Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia fergusonii, Shigella boydii, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei. In many of these organisms the aerobactin pathway enhances virulence.\r\n\r\nFerric aerobactin uptake\r\nAerobactin transport across outer membrane is mediated by IutA � a highly specific TonB-dependent receptor.  It is highly conserved and is easily identifiable in the majority of organisms capable of aerobactin biosynthesis, as well as in those that appear to utilize it as a heterologous siderophore (in the absence of aerobactin internal synthesis).  In the other hand, transport of ferric aerobactin (and other iron(III) hydroxamates) across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm appears to be far less specific, and is far less understood.  In E. coli, for example, the FhuCDB ferric hydroxamate transporter (essential for uptake of Fe(III)-aerobactin) also accepts at least five different siderophores of the hydroxamate type as substrates (Braun et al., 1983; K�ster, 1991).  \r\n\r\nSituation is similar in P. aeruginosa, where in silico genome analysis indicated the presence of relatively few siderophore inner-membrane iron-transport systems with respect to the number of putative siderophore receptors (O Cuiv et al., 2006; K�ster, 2001).  Currently, the only inner-membrane siderophore transporter identified in P. aeruginosa is the single-subunit FptX permease, implicated in pyochelin utilization (� Cu�v et al., 2004).  It is not clear at the moment how ferric aerobactin crosses inner membrane in P. aeruginosa, as well as in several other species.  \r\n",

        "description":"Compatible solutes (Brown, 1976) are highly water-soluble organic compounds, that cells accumulate in order to maintain an osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium (Roberts, 2006).  They are beneficial not only as osmoregulators, but also as protectants of proteins by mitigating detrimental effects of freezing, drying and high temperatures.  The predominant compatible solutes in halophilic Bacteria are the amino acid derivatives glycine-betaine and ectoine (Roberts, 2006; Oren, 2008).  Most chemoheterotrophic bacteria can readily use glycine-betaine as a compatible solute if it is available in the environment.  However, only a few are capable of de novo synthesis of glycine-betaine (Nyyssoet al., 2000). Far more prokaryotes synthesize aspartate derivatives ectoine (1,4,5,6,tetra-2-methyl-4-pyrimidonecarboxylic acid) or hydroxyectoine as their main compatible solute (Schwibbert  et al., 2011 and references therein). Ectoine biosynthesis process is encoded in another Subsystem �Ectoine synthesis� and is not covered here\r\n\r\nEctoine and hydroxyectoine can also be utilized as both a carbon and a nitrogen source by halophilic bacteria.  This SS covers uptake and utilization of these compounds.   Ectoine degradation has been studied in Sinorhizobium meliloti (Jebbar et al., 2005) and more recently in Halomonas elongata DSM 2581 T (Schwibbert et al., 2011).  In the latter organism the degradation of ectoine was reported to proceed via �\r\n- hydrolysis of ectoine (DoeA) to the novel compound N-alpha-acetyl-l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, \r\n- deacetylation of N-alpha-acetyl-l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DoeB) to l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, \r\n- and a transaminase reaction (DoeD) leading to aspartate-semialdehyde. \r\n- Finally, aspartate-semialdehyde is oxidized by DoeC to aspartate (Fig. 1). \r\n\r\nWhile homologue for each of the S. meliloti genes eutBCDE can be found in H. elongata (Fig. 4), but no eutA homologue could be identified.  EutA homolog is often lacking in other organisms with other ectoine degradation genes present and might not be as essential component of this pathway\r\n\r\nObservations, predictions:\r\n\r\n1. Two different transportes, an ABC type one or a TRAP type, are often located in the immediate visinity of ectoine degradation genes. Both are included in this Subsystem\r\n\r\n2. The gene encoding N-alpha-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutyrate deacetylase (doeB) is missing in about a third of genomes with otherwise complete ectoine degradation pathway.  In all these cases an alternative putative deacetylase gene is present in the ectoin catabolic cluster, currently annotated in this database as:  �Predicted alternative deacetylase in ectoine utilization (replaces DoeB)�  We predict that this enzyme either functionally fully replaces DoeB in such cases (a synonymous enzyme) , or the ectoin degradation pathway slightly differes in these organism (e.g. proceeds via N-GAMMA-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutyrate), as suggested in (Schwibbert et al., 2011)\r\n\r\n3. The gene encoding Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (doeC) is missing in about a third of genomes s well (different genomes from those above).  No replacement candidate is suggested at the moment, but possibly another DH (e.g. from succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase superfamily) can fulfill this role\r\n",

        "notes":["Notes on reaction reversibility:\n\nAll the reactions catalyzed by enzymes of this node are annotated as reversible in KEGG, which is not really the case under physiological conditions.   Pyruvate carboxyl transferase (EC 6.4.1.1) and Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) operate strictly in the direction of C3-carboxylation.  Oxaloacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.3) is a strictly C4-decarboxylating enzyme.   The following enzymes catalyze reversible reactions, but their primary function in vivo is C4-decarboxylation:  Malic enzyme, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.   Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic, while Pyruvate,phosphate dikinase and Phosphoenolpyruvate synthase function in the gluconeogenesis. \n\nMalic enzyme (ME, ME-P):\n\nIt is impossible to distinguish between the three variants of malic enzyme based on the protein sequence alone.  Substrate specificity (NADP vs NAD) is well established only in the following phyla, where experimental measurements have been performed for at least one representative:  E. coli and other enteric bacteria, B. subtilis, Rhizobium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Alcaligines faecalis, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Cyanobacterias, some Archaea.  Lactic acid bacteria (with a few exceptions) possess Malolactic enzyme (EC 1.-.-.-), which converts malate directly to lactate, instead of malic enzyme.  In other species substrate specificity listed here can be incorrect. \n\nOxaloacetate decarboxylases (ODC)  fall into four classes: \n\n1. The 3-4 subunit membrane-bound Na+-translocating ODC [e.g. of Klebsiella sp. (Dimroth 1986)];  \n2. The divalent-cation-dependent cytoplasmic ODC [e.g. of C.glutamicum (Jetten et al., 1995)].  As of August 2006, no protein sequence has been associate with this enzyme.\n3.  An unusual ODC that belongs to malic enzyme family, and is specifically involved in citrate fermentation [e.g. E. faecalis (Sender et al., 2003)], with the corresponding genes clustering with citrate metabolic genes\n4.  The ODC activity of a diverse group of enzymes like pyruvate  kinase, malic enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase (Creighton  & Rose 1976; Ivanichev & Kurganov 1993)\n\nPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC):\n\nA novel type of PEP carboxylase has been recently discovered in Archaea (Patel et al., 2004).  It has no discernable evolutionary relationship with previously described PEPCs.  Its homologs are present in most archaeal genomes, but only in three bacterial (Clostridium perfringens, Oenococcus oeni, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) and in no eukaryotic genomes.  Each PEPCa-containing organism lacks a �classic� PEPC homolog (Patel et al., 2004). \n\n\nReferences\n\nMany.

Each eib gene was transferred to test E. coli strains, both in the form of multicopy recombinant plasmids and as lysogenized prophage. The derived lysogens express little or no Eib protein, in sharp contrast to the parental lysogen, suggesting that ECOR-9 has an expression-enhancing activity that the derived lysogens lack. Supporting this hypothesis, we cloned from ECOR-9 overlapping genes, ibrA and ibrB (designation is derived from \"immunoglobulin-binding regulator\"), which together activated eib expression in the derived lysogens. The proteins encoded by ibrA and ibrB are very similar to uncharacterized proteins encoded by genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and E. coli O157:H7 (in a prophage-like element of the Sakai strain and in two O islands of strain EDL933). The genomic segment containing ibrA and ibrB has been designated the IbrAB island. It contains regions of homology to the Shiga toxin-converting prophage, Stx2, as well as genes homologous to phage antirepressor genes. The left boundary between the IbrAB island and the chromosomal framework is located near min 35.8 of the E. coli K-12 genome. Homology to IbrAB was found in certain other ECOR strains, including the other five eib-positive strains and most strains of the phylogenetic group B2. Sequencing of a 1.1-kb portion of ibrAB revealed that the other eib-positive strains diverge by </=0.1% from ECOR-9, whereas eib-negative ECOR-47 diverges by 16%.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 12057959\r\n###############################\r\nLITERATURE\r\n"],

        "description":"Under iron-limiting growth conditions Pseudomonas  aeruginosa produces two major siderophores: hydroxamate siderophore pyoverdin (Meyer & Abdallah, 1978; Cox & Adams, 1985) and catechol siderophore pyochelin (Cox, 1980; Rinehart et al., 1995).  Of the two pyoverdin has a greater  affinity for Fe(II1) than has pyochelin (Cox & Graham,  1979).  It is encoded in a separate SS: \"Pyoverdine biosynthesis new\"\r\n\r\nPyochelin is derived from one molecule of salicylate and two molecules of cysteine.  The enzymes for the synthesis (PchBA) and activation (PchD) of salicylate as well as a putative thioesterase (PchC) are encoded by pchDCBA operon.  This operon also includes two coregulated genes, pchEF, encoding peptide synthetases.  The pchE is required for the conversion of salicylate to dihydroaeruginoate (Dha), the condensation product of salicylate and one cysteine residue, and pchF is essential for the synthesis of pyochelin from Dha (Reimmann et al., 1998). The deduced PchE (156 kDa) and PchF (197 kDa) proteins have adenylation, thiolation and condensation/cyclization motifs arranged as modules which are typical of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases forming thiazoline rings.\r\n\r\nWhen secreted to the extracellular environment, pyochelin chelates iron and transports it to the bacterial cytoplasm via specific outer-membrane receptor FptA and the inner-membrane permease FptX.  Exogenously added pyochelin also acts as a signal which induces the expression of the pyochelin biosynthesis and uptake genes by activating PchR, a cytoplasmic regulatory protein of the AraC/XylS family.\r\n\r\nIn addition to P. aeruginosa, pyochelin production was documented in Burkholderia sp. (Darling et al., 1998; Visser  et al., 2004), and pyochelin biosynthetic genes are highly conserved in the sequenced genomes of multiple Burkholderia species.  Notably, the presence of an operon similar to fptABCX in Rhodospirillum rubrum indicates that it might be able to utilize pyochelin as a heterologous siderophore for iron uptake (Michel et al., 2007)\r\n\r\nAnother interesting insight into such siderophore piracy was provided recently by discovery of enantio-pyochelin, an optical antipode of pyochelin, which is produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens strains Pf-5 and CHA0 produce (Youard et al., 2007).  The two different pyochelin enantiomers (produced by P. fluorescens CHA0 and P. aeruginosa PAO1) cannot be utilized as an iron source in the heterologous background. This strategy is believed to prevent potential competitors occupying the same ecological niche from stealing heterologous iron-siderophore complexes (Youard et al., 2007)\r\n",

        "notes":["Proline is not only an essential component of proteins but it also has important roles in adaptation to osmotic and dehydration stresses, redox control, and apoptosis. Here we review pathways of proline biosynthesis in the three biological domains. Pathway reconstruction from genome data for hundreds of eubacterial and dozens of archaeal and eukaryotic organisms in this Subsystem revealed evolutionary conservation and variations of this pathway across different taxa. In the most prevalent pathway of proline synthesis, glutamate is phosphorylated to gamma-glutamyl phosphate by gamma-glutamyl kinase, reduced to gamma-glutamyl semialdehyde by gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase, cyclizes spontaneously to delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and reduced to proline by delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. In higher plants and animals the first two steps are catalyzed by a bi-functional delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase. Alternate pathways of proline formation use the initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway to ornithine, which can be converted to delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by ornithine aminotransferease and then reduced to proline or directly to proline by ornithine cyclodeaminase; in some organisms, the latter pathways contribute to or could be fully responsible for the synthesis of proline (Fichman et al., 2013)\r\n"],

The enzyme(s) responsible for dehydration of (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP during the elongation cycles of the mycobacterial FAS-II remained unknown. This step is classically catalyzed by FabZ- and FabA-type enzymes in bacteria, but no such proteins are present in mycobacteria. Bioinformatic analyses and an essentiality study allowed the identification of a candidate protein cluster, Rv0635-Rv0636-Rv0637. Its expression in recombinant Escherichia coli strains leads to the formation of two heterodimers, Rv0635-Rv0636 (HadAB) and Rv0636-Rv0637 (HadBC), which also occurs in Mycobacterium smegmatis, as shown by split-Trp assays. Both heterodimers exhibit the enzymatic properties expected for mycobacterial FAS-II dehydratases: a marked specificity for both long-chain (longer or equal C-12) and ACP-linked substrates. Furthermore, they function as 3-hydroxyacyl dehydratases when coupled with MabA and InhA enzymes from the M. tuberculosis FAS-II system. HadAB and HadBC are the long-sought (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases. The correlation between the substrate specificities of these enzymes, the organization of the orthologous gene cluster in different Corynebacterineae, and the structure of their mycolic acids suggests distinct roles for both heterodimers during the elongation process. This work describes bacterial monofunctional (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases belonging to the hydratase 2 family. Their original structure and the fact that they are essential for M. tuberculosis survival make these enzymes very good candidates for the development of antimycobacterial drugs.\r\n\r\nPMID:17804795\r\n"],

USA. 93:10151-10155.\n\nKEGG and UniProt call this protein \"regulator for deo operon, udp, cdd, tsx, nupC, and nupG\".\n\nCytR is similar to many transcriptonal regulators, and the circumscription is uncertain.\n\nVariant codes:\n\n-1 - not identified\n 1 - identified###############################\nLITERATURE\n"],

        "description":"Violacein is a violet pigment produced by Gram-negative bacteria living in tropical aqueous environments and soils. It is produced from the condensation of two L-tryptophans and the addition of molecular oxygen. The structure of violacein is made up of three structural units:  a 5-hydroxyindole, an oxindole, and a 2-pyyrolidone. The function of violacein may be to protect the bacterium from UV radiation. This pigment has potential medical applications as antibacterial, anti-trypanocidal, anti-ulcerogenic, and anticancer drugs.\nA 14-electron oxidation pathway yields the final chromophore. The flavoenzyme VioA and the heme protein VioB work in conjunction to oxidize and dimerize l-tryptophan to a nascent product that can default to the off pathway metabolite chromopyrrolic acid. In the presence of VioE, the intermediate instead undergoes on-pathway [1,2] indole rearrangement to prodeoxyviolacein. The last two enzymes in the pathway are flavin-dependent oxygenases, VioC and VioD, that act sequentially. VioD hydroxylates one indole ring at the 5-position to yield proviolacein, and VioC then acts on the other indole ring at the 2-position to create the oxindole and complete violacein formation.\n",

        "description":"Chorismate is a branch point in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Chorismate is also a major branch point for other important aromatic compounds, including antibiotics, vitamins to name a few. This subsystem covers the genes and proteins that lead from chorismate to the biosynthesis of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. Chorismate mutase (AroH) takes chorismate to prephenate. There are several non-homologous-types of AroH: 1) AroHI, and a periplasmic precursor (*AroHI) which are homologs; 2)AroHII in bacteria and Archaea; and 3) the plant type, AroAIII). \r\n\r\nPrephenate is another branch point which takes prephenate to either phenylalanine or tyrosine. The enzyme steps to phenylalanine include an aminotransferase and a dehydatase which can occur in either reaction order. Prephenat dehydratase (PheAIp) takes prephenate to phenylpyruvate which is then transaminated in the presence of an amino acid donor such as L-glutamate to form L-phenylalanine.  In the opposite order of reaction steps, prephenate is transaminated to form L-arogenate and arogenate dehydratase (PheAIa) then uses the L-arogenate to produce L-phenylalanine. There is also a periplasmic precursor cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (*PheAIIc).\r\n\r\nFor the tyrosine pathway, prephenate dehydrogenase (TyrAp) takes prephenate to 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate which is then transaminated to form L-tyrosine in the presence of the amino acid donor. The reverse order of reaction steps occur when prephenate is first transaminated to form L-arogenate, followed by arogenate dehydrogenase (TyrAa) which forms L-tyrosine from L-arogenate. Cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase (TyrAc) uses either of the two substrates (prephenate or arogenate) to ultimately synthesize L-tyrosine. These dehydrogenases use either NAD, NADP or both (NAD(P)H) and are sorted as such in the subsystem.\r\n\r\nThe aminotransferases are divided into several classes: Biosynthetic Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase alpha (AroJI&#945;), Biosynthetic Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase beta (AroJI&#946;), periplasmic aromatic amino acid aminotransferase beta precursor (*AroJI&#946;), and Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase gamma (AroJI&#947;).\r\n\r\nAuxiliary functional roles include homologs that may be confused with the actual pathway functional role such as 4-amino, 4-deoxychorismate mutase (PapB) and Isochorismate mutase (PchB) which are homologs of chorismate mutase; and 4-amino, 4-deoxyprephenate dehydrogenase (PapC), a homolog of  prephenate dehydrogenase.\n\n\n\n",

        "description":"In some Bacilli, the distinct outermost layer of spores are well separated from the spore coat. The exosporium is composed of one or more paracrystalline layers surrounded by an outermost 'hairy nap' layer.\r\n\r\nThe precise function of the exosporium is not known. However, as it makes up the surface of the endospore that is exposed to the environment, it may be important in attachment and colonization. The exosporium is also the site of major spore surface antigens. In B. anthracis it may contribute to protection of the spore from the macrophage, masking epitopes recognized by the macrophage, although it is not essential for virulence. The exosporium is composed of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, and it is synthesized and assembled concomitantly with the cortex and the coat.\r\n\r\nThe exosporium is a loose-fitting, balloon-like structure composed of a paracrystalline basal layer and an external hair-like nap. The filaments of the hair-like nap are formed by a single collagen-like glycoprotein called BclA, whereas the basal layer is composed of a number of different proteins in tight and loose associations.\r\n\r\nThe basal layer proteins also include three enzymes: alanine racemase, inosine-uridine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase, and superoxide dismutase. These proteins may not be structural elements but merely very strongly adsorbed. The first two enzymes degrade the germinants L-alanine and inosine, respectively, and may function to suppress germination. Superoxide dismutase could protect the spore from reactive oxygen species during infection, participate in oxidative cross-linking of coat or exosporium proteins, or moderate germination efficiency upon exposure to superoxide.\r\n\r\nA processed CotE spore morphogenetic protein is also located in the exosporium (CotE is a major morphogenetic protein in spore coat assembly and is situated between the inner and outer coat layers of the mature spore).\r\n\r\nBesides the BclA glycoprotein, at least 10 more proteins are tightly associated with the exosporium of B. cereus ATCC 10876, as identified by N-terminal sequencing of proteins from purified, washed exosporium. Eight genes encode likely structural components (exsB, exsC, exsD, exsE, exsF, exsG, exsJ, and cotE). ExsJ is a glycoprotein. Most of the exosporium genes are scattered on the genome.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Lysozymes are implicated in defensive and offensive bactericidal systems in a wide range of taxonomically diverse organisms including fungi, protozoa, plants, invertebrate and vertebrate animals and even bacteriophages. Bacteria have in turn evolved mechanisms to evade or subvert this threat, most commonly by peptidoglycan modification. A different bacterial strategy to evade the bactericidal action of lysozyme is the production of lysozyme inhibitors.\r\nThe location of the bacterial lysozyme inhibitors either in the periplasm (Inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme precursor Ivy and Periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme PliC) or anchored to the luminal face of the outer membrane (Membrane-bound lysozyme inhibitor of c-type lysozyme MliC) is consistent with a role in protecting peptidoglycan from hydrolysis by exogenous lysozymes. \n\n",

F1, which can easily be separated from the membranes and shows ATPase activity, is composed of two kinds of nucleotide binding subunits,alpha  and beta, and three minor subunits, gamma, delta, and epsilon with a stoichiometry alpha3beta3gamma,delta,epsilon.

        "description":"Fluoroquinolones are synthetic derivatives of nalidixic acid and exhibit broad-spectrum and powerful antibacterial activity. Quinolones act by converting their targets into toxic enzymes that fragment the bacterial chromosome. Quinolone resistance normally arises by mutations in the molecular targets (DNA gyrase GyrA and topoisomerase IV) or chromosomal genes for type II topoisomerases (GyrA, GyrB). It can also be achieved through, efflux pumps and their regulatory genes or by plasmid/chromosome-mediated DNA gyrase protection through pentapeptide repeat proteins. Two other resistance mechanisms are mediated by aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Ib-cr and QepA and described in the subsystem \"Resistance to the fluoroquinolones norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin\".\r\n\r\nMfpA, a member of the pentapeptide repeat family, causes resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. This protein binds to DNA gyrase and inhibits its activity. Its three-dimensional structure reveals a fold, that exhibits size, shape, and electrostatic similarity to B-form DNA. This represents a form of DNA mimicry and explains both its inhibitory effect on DNA gyrase and fluoroquinolone resistance resulting from the protein's expression in vivo.\r\n",

The omptins are multifunctional, and the individual omptins exhibit differing virulence-associated functions. The Pla plasminogen activator of Yersinia pestis contributes by several mechanisms to bacterial invasiveness and the systemic, uncontrolled proteolysis in plague. Pla proteolytically activates the human proenzyme plasminogen and inactivates the antiprotease alpha2-antiplasmin, and its binding to laminin localizes the uncontrolled plasmin activity onto basement membranes. These properties enhance bacterial migration through tissue barriers. Pla also degrades circulating complement proteins and functions in bacterial invasion into human epithelial cells. PgtE of Salmonella enterica and OmpT of Escherichia coli have been shown to degrade cationic antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells or macrophages. PgtE and SopA of Shigella flexneri appear important in the intracellular phases of salmonellosis and shigellosis, whereas functions of OmpT have mainly been associated with protein degradation in E. coli cells. The differing virulence roles and functions have been attributed to minor sequence variations at the surface-exposed regions important for substrate recognition, to the dependence of omptin functions on lipopolysaccharide, and to the different regulation of omptin expression.\r\n",

Since the lcfA-fadRB-etfBA, lcfB, and fadNAE operons, whose gene products directly participate in the &#946;-oxidation cycle, had been found to be probably catabolite repressed upon genome-wide transcript analysis, we performed Northern blotting, which indicated that they are clearly under CcpA-dependent catabolite repression. So, we searched for catabolite-responsive elements (cre's) to which the complex of CcpA and P-Ser-HPr binds to exert catabolite repression by means of a web-based cis-element search in the B. subtilis genome using known cre sequences, which revealed the respective candidate cre sequences in the lcfA, lcfB, and fadN genes. DNA footprinting indicated that the complex actually interacted with these cre's in vitro. Deletion analysis of each cre using the lacZ fusions with the respective promoter regions of the three operons with and without it, indicated that these cre's are involved in the CcpA-dependent catabolite repression of the operons in vivo.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ Biol Chem. 2007 Feb 23;282(8):5180-94.

PMID:17189250\r\nOrganization and function of the YsiA regulon of Bacillus subtilis involved in fatty acid degradation.\r\nMatsuoka H1, Hirooka K, Fujita Y.\r\nAbstract\r\nThe organization and function of the Bacillus subtilis YsiA regulon involved in fatty acid degradation were investigated. Northern and primer extension analyses indicated that this regulon comprises five operons, i.e. lcfA-ysiA-B-etfB-A, ykuF-G, yhfL, yusM-L-K-J, and ywjF-acdA-rpoE. YusJ and AcdA, YsiB and YusL, and YusK presumably encode acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, 3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase complexes, and acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, respectively, which are directly involved in the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. In addition, LcfA and YhfL are likely to encode long chain acyl-CoA ligases. On gel retardation and footprinting analyses involving the purified YsiA protein, we identified cis-sequences for YsiA binding (YsiA boxes) in the promoter regions upstream of ysiA, ykuF, yusL, yhfL, and ywjF, the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)) for YsiA binding being 20, 21, 37, 43, and 65 nm, respectively. YsiA binding was specifically inhibited by long chain acyl-CoAs with 14-20 carbon atoms, acyl-CoAs with 18 carbon atoms being more effective; out of long chain acyl-CoAs tested, monounsaturated oleoyl-CoA, and branched chain 12-metyltetradecanoyl-CoA were most effective. These in vitro findings were supported by the in vivo observation that the knock-out of acyl-CoA dehydrogenation through yusJ, etfA, or etfB disruption resulted in YsiA inactivation, probably because of the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoAs in the cells. Furthermore, the disruption of yusL, yusK, yusJ, etfA, etfB, or ykuG affected the utilization of palmitic acid, a representative long chain fatty acid. Based on this work, ysiA, ysiB, ykuF, ykuG, yhfL, yusM, yusL, yusK, yusJ, and ywjF can be renamed fadR, fadB, fadH, fadG, lcfB, fadM, fadN, fadA, fadE, and fadF.\r\n"],

        "description":"The shikimate pathway, including seven enzymatic steps for production of chorismate via shikimate from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, is common in various organisms for the biosynthesis of not only aromatic amino acids but also most biogenic benzene derivatives. \n\n3-Amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) is a benzene derivative serving as a precursor for several secondary metabolites like grixazone produced by Streptomyces griseus. The biosynthesis pathway of grixazone led to identification of the biosynthesis pathway of 3,4-AHBA from two primary metabolites. GriI and GriH, within the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster were found to be responsible for the biosynthesis of 3,4-AHBA. GriI catalyzes the aldol condensation between two primary metabolites, l-aspartate-4-semialdehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, to form a 7-carbon product, 2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-6-one-heptanoic acid-7-phosphate, which is subsequently converted to 3,4-AHBA by GriH. The latter reaction requires Mn(2+), but no other cofactor. This pathway is independent of the shikimate pathway, representing a novel, simple enzyme system responsible for the synthesis of a benzene ring from the C(3) and C(4) primary metabolites.\n\nAlternative biochemistry:\n6-deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate and l-aspartate semialdehyde are precursors to DHQ. The sugar, which is derived from glucose 6-P, supplies a \"hydroxyacetone\" fragment, which, via a transaldolase reaction, undergoes an aldol condensation with the l-aspartate semialdehyde to form 2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonic acid. Despite the fact that both hydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetone-P were measured in the cell extracts and confirmed to arise from glucose 6-P, neither compound was found to serve as a precursor to DHQ. This amino sugar then undergoes a NAD dependent oxidative deamination to produce 3,7-dideoxy-d-threo-hept-2,6-diulosonic acid which cyclizes to 3-dehydroquinate. The protein product of the M. jannaschii MJ0400 gene catalyzes the transaldolase reaction and the protein product of the MJ1249 gene catalyzes the oxidative deamination and the cyclization reactions.\n\n",

However, the Enzyme Commission has adopted a different systemic name (7-phospho-2-oxo-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase (pyruvate phosphorylating), EC 4.1.2.15) and recommemded the use of the trivial name, phospho-2-keto-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase.

PCR amplifications with primers\r\n    complementary to conserved regions within these three genes, and\r\n    subsequent DNA sequencing of rpsU-dnaG PCR products, demonstrate\r\n    that the three genes appear to be contiguous in 11 different\r\n    Gram-negative species. Within the Gram-negative enteric bacterial\r\n    lineage, the S21 amino acid sequence is absolutely conserved in 10\r\n    species examined. The putative nuteq antiterminator sequence in\r\n    rpsU consists of two motifs, boxA and boxB, conserved in primary\r\n    sequence and secondary structure. The terminator sequence, T1,\r\n    located between rpsU and dnaG is conserved at 31 positions in nine\r\n    enterobacterial species, suggesting the importance of primary\r\n    sequence in addition to secondary structure for transcription\r\n    termination. The intergenic region between rpsU and dnaG varies in\r\n    size owing to the presence or absence of the Enterobacterial\r\n    Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) DNA element. The rpoD gene\r\n    contains rearrangements involving a divergent sequence, although\r\n    two carboxy-terminal regions which encode functional domains are\r\n    conserved in primary sequence and spacing. Our data suggest that\r\n    primary sequence divergence and DNA rearrangements in both coding\r\n    and non-coding sequences account for the interspecies variation in\r\n    operon structure. However, MMS operon gene organization and\r\n    cis-acting regulatory sequences appear to be conserved in diverse\r\n    bacteria.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 8316085 \r\n\r\n\r\n"],

        "description":"  Methylglyoxal is an electrophile, which at high concentrations can cause cell death. Methylglyoxal reacts rapidly with both proteins and nucleic acids and thus is both toxic and mutagenic. It is a natural metabolite that is related to intermediates in the glycolytic sequence, e.g. dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and its detoxification leads to the production of D-lactate.\r\n The main source of methylglyoxal is the nonenzymatic fragmentation of triose phosphates, but it also is formed during threonine catabolism and acetone oxidation. In some prokaryotes, dihydroxyacetone phosphate is enzymatically converted to methylglyoxal and inorganic phosphate by methylglyoxal synthase (EC 4.2.3.3) in response to phosphate starvation. \r\n\r\n The production of methylglyoxal by cells is a paradox that can be resolved by assigning an important role in adaptation to conditions of nutrient imbalance. Analysis of a methylglyoxal synthase-deficient mutant provides evidence that methylglyoxal production is required to allow growth under certain environmental conditions. The production of methylglyoxal may represent a high-risk strategy that facilitates adaptation, but which on failure leads to cell death.\r\n Prevention of methylglyoxal accumulation can be controlled at the level of detoxification. Several methylglyoxal detoxification pathways have been identified.\r\n\r\n In enteric bacteria, three detoxification routes have been identified:\r\n(1) the glutathione-dependent glyoxalase I-II system,\r\n(2) glutathione-independent glyoxalase III, and \r\n(3) methylglyoxal reductases and dehydrogenases.\r\n\r\n The major detoxification system in Escherichia coli, the glutathione-dependent glyoxalase I-II system, is conserved from bacteria to man, and this implies universal exposure to this compound at some stage of all life cycles.\r\n\r\n*******FUNCTIONAL VARIANTS:********\r\n\r\n1.0 - Methylglyoxal formation(mgs) + Main (Glyoxalase I-II) detoxification pathway are present;\r\n2.0 � Methylglyoxal formation(mgs) + Alternate detoxification routes;\r\n3.0 - Methylglyoxal formation(mgs) + Main and alternate detoxification routes;\r\n4.0 - Just Main (Glyoxalase I-II) detoxification pathway (No mgs gene -non-enzymatic formation of methylglyoxal);\r\n5.0 - Just Alternate detoxification routes ( No mgs gene);\r\n6.0 - No formation, but both - Main and alternate- detoxification routes are present;        \r\n9.0 - Just Methylglyoxal formation(mgs gene), no detoxification routes found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n",

In E. coli encoded by the mgs gene. The corresponding gene in eukaryotic cells has yet to be characterized.\r\n\r\n#2 -Lactoylglutathione lyase (EC 4.4.1.5) - Glyoxalase I  - catalyzes the first of two sequential steps in the conversion of methylgloxal to D-lactate. The enzyme tightly binds one ion of nickel per enzyme dimer and is the first example of a Ni-containing isomerase.Glyoxalase I isomerises hemithiolacetal to S-lactoylglutathione, which is the substrate for glyoxalase II. Glutathione is released during the conversion of S-lactoylglutathione to D-lactate by glyoxalase II. The gene for glyoxalase I has been cloned from E. coli, S. typhimurium and Pseudomonas putida; and shows high levels of sequence conservation with the human colon enzyme\r\n\r\n#3 -Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.6) -  Glyoxalase II  -catalyzes the second of two sequential reactions in the conversion of methylglyoxal to D-lactate. Bacterial glyoxalase II has been less well characterised, but the structural gene has recently been cloned from E. coli. The protein is approximately 29 kDa and shows considerable similarity with the human homologue (approximately 60% sequence similarity in each case). In contrast to glyoxalase I, the human and bacterial enzymes have similar masses and show only small discontinuities in the sequence match. Gene sequences that could encode homologues of glyoxalase II are widespread among prokaryotes, including the archaea and gram-positive bacteria. Several organisms, including E. coli, have two ORFs with similarity to the human glyoxalase II.\r\n\r\nGlyoxalase III  - is a newly discovered enzyme in E. coli K-12 that converts methylglyoxal into D-lactate in one step without the use of GSH. Previously the only known route for this conversion was the two-step pathway catalyzed by glyoxalase I and II, utilizing GSH. Glyoxalase III has been partially characterized but its genetics are unknown. ( Ref.4)\r\n\r\n#6 - Methylglyoxal reductase  - catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal into lactaldehyde. The lactaldehyde is then acted upon by lactaldehyde dehydrogenase yielding lactate. This provides an alternate route for methylglyoxal metabolism. Methylglyoxal reductase is an important enzyme in controlling methylglyoxal levels in eukaryotic cells, catalyzing the reduction of 2-oxoaldehydes to the corresponding 2-hydroxyaldehydes, and catalysing aldehydes to alcohols. However, the physiological significance of these enzymes in E. coli is debatable. An NADH- and an NADPH-dependent �methylglyoxal dehydrogenase�have been purified from E. coli.\r\n\r\n=====AUX functional role:============\r\n\r\n   Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase D precursor (EC 3.2.1.-) - in cluster with Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.6) in more than 100 spicies; all E.coli, Salmonella, Shewanella, Yersinia, Bordetella, Azotobacter, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Vibrio.  \r\n\r\n\r\n========REFERENCES================\r\n1a.

Present in the hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanothermobacter, Methanopyrus, Methanococcus, Methanocaldococcus.  This class of enzymes reduces low potential electron acceptors (midpoint potential ~-500 mV) with hydrogen gas.  Since this reaction is unfavorable, it is driven by the proton motive force.  Some organisms possess two homologs of this system (eha and ehb).  These reactions are required to generate the reductant for the first step in methanogenesis (formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase reaction) and a number of anabolic reactions such those catalyzed by acetyl-CoA synthase, pyruvate oxidoreductase and other ferredoxin-dependent oxidoreductases. \r\n\r\nehaI, ehaI2,ehaI3 were named according to position.

My interpretation is: the ancestral state was three paralogs represented by ehaP, ehaP3 and ehaU.  All modern lineages contain ehaU.  In Methanothermobacter, the ehaP3 paralog was lost and replaced by a duplication of ehaP.  In Methanopyrus, the ehaP was inherited unchanged.  In addition, the C-terminal of ehaP3 was lost and replaced by a new gene derived from the C-terminal of ehaP (which I called ehaP2).  For Methanococcus and Methanocaldococcus, the ehaP3 paralog was inherited intact.  However, the N-terminal portion of ehaP paralog was lost, forming a ehaP2 homolog.  \r\n"],

        "description":"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have important structural roles in cell membranes.  In higher eukaryotes they are also intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active molecules such as eicosanoids, which mediate fever, inflammation, blood pressure and neurotransmission.  Lower eukaryotes are particularly rich in C20-22 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fungi and marine microalgae are currently used to produce dietary nutrients for neonatal babies, since arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids are essential components of brain tissues required for the development of neural and retinal functions\r\n\r\nUntil the 1990s it was thought that, with the exception of cyanobacteria, bacteria had no polyunsaturated fatty acids.  It has since been found that omega-3 long-chain PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are preferentially distributed in psychrophilic bacteria that inhabit low-temperature deep-sea environments and the intestines of sea &#64257;sh. After the discovery of the EPA biosynthetic pfa genes (Yazawa et al., 1996; Metz et al., 2001), their  homologues were detected in sequenced genomes of various marine bacteria.  The  pfa genes of Moritella marina MP-1 were the &#64257;rst genes to be  cloned from DHA-producing bacteria (Tanaka et al., 1999).   Notably, PUFAs detected in bacteria are mostly EPA or DHA and not C18 PUFAs such as linoleic and linolenic acids, which are most common in animals, plants, fungi, and cyanobacteria.   \r\n\r\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids can be synthesized by two different pathways: an anaerobic one, by using polyketide synthase related enzymes, and an aerobic one, which involves the action of elongases and oxygen dependent desaturases.  Only the former is encoded in this Subsystem. It is the only PUFA biosynthetic pathway known for prokaryotes (Metz et al., 2001), it is currently under intense investigation\r\n",

        "description":"Pyoverdines (PVDs) are complex siderophores produced by members of the fluorescent Pseudomonas. They comprise a dihydroxyquinoline fluorescent chromophore joined to a peptide of remarkably variable length and composition. Close to 40 structurally different pyoverdines have been identified to date,\r\nfrom different species of Pseudomonas, with each strain making a single (and characteristic) form of pyoverdine; although they can utilize many different pyoverdines. As a fluorescent pigment, it represents a useful marker for bacterial differentiation. P. aeruginosa strains, for example, secrete one of three distinct pyoverdines (Types I�III). Pyoverdines are composed of three parts: (i) a fluorescent dihydroxyquinoline chromophore that is common to all pyoverdines; (ii) an acyl side chain (either dicarboxylic acid or amide) bound to the amino group of the chromophore; and (iii) a strain-specific peptide chain linked via an amide bound to the C1 (rarely C3) carboxyl group of the chromophore.\r\n\r\nPyoverdines are of considerable scientific interest because of their contribution to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa (Meyer et al. 1996; Takase et al. 2000) and because of their role in the ecology of soil pseudomonads and their possible involvement in biological control of plant pathogens (Loper and Henkels 1999; Weller et al. 2002)\r\n\r\nGenes responsible for the biosynthesis, excretion, uptake and regulation of these high-affinity siderophores are located either at a single locus or at up to three different loci in the genomes of the four pseudomonads analyzed. The peptide backbone of PVD is assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and modified by accessory enzymes in the cytoplasm, and probably the periplasm. Regulation of PVD production and uptake depends on two extracytoplasmic sigma factors (ECF-sigmas), PvdS and FpvI, together with one anti-sigma, FpvR.\n",

        "notes":["Comments, observations\r\n\r\n1. Many species of Burkholderia contain several genes related to those of pyoverdine biosynthesis of Pseudomonas, grouped in a small cluster (Variant code 9). It is not clear, if these proteins are indeed involved in some type of pyoverdine biosynthesis.  There are two notable points, however:\r\n- this cluster contains putative PvdA and PvdF homologs, which encode L-ornithine N5-monooxygenase and N5-hydroxyornithine formyltransferase respectively\r\n- genes of an inducible arginine deiminase pathway (which produces ATP via fermentation of arginine into ortnithine) are located near-by in Burkholderia mallei\r\n- Fe transporting systems are also near � some type of siderophore is being produced from ornithine?\r\n\r\n2. The pvcABCD genes have been included in this Subsystem merely as auxiliary roles.  This operon has been associated with pyoverdine maturation by (Stintzi et al. 1996, 1999).  However, no expression of these genes could be detected during active pyoverdine biosynthesis by (Zaborin et al., 2008).  Involvement of this operon in PYO production was also doubted by (Visca, Imperi, Lamont, 2007)\r\n\r\n3. The l-2,4-diaminobutyrate, which is required for pyoverdine synthesis, is produced by the aminotransferase PvdH. It has been predicted that during the synthesis of the pyoverdine chromophore, PvdL, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, catalyzes the peptide linkage between l-2,4-diaminobutyrate and d-tyrosine (26). The enzyme required for cyclization of l-2,4-diaminobutyrate to form the pyrimidine ring of the pyoverdine chromophore remains to be discovered\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nLeoni L, Ciervo A, Orsi N, Visca P.  1996.

        "description":"The \"Respiratory Systems - Shewanella\" subsystem is being created to summarize the suite of respiratory systems that are found in the sequenced members of this genus in one place.\r\n\r\nWe have used as a starting point, \"Fe(III) respiration - Shewanella type\" (svetag).\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nNotes from \"Fe(III) respiration - Shewanella type\" below this point:\r\n-------------\r\nThis Subsystem has been encode by Margaret Romine, whose contributions to SEED we gratefully acknowledge.\r\nThis subsystem describes the Fe(III) respiratory system found in Shewanella species.  This system is believed to enable their hosts to utilize both insoluble (Fe, Mn) and soluble metals (V, U) as terminal electron acceptors.  Other bacteria such as Geobacter and Anaeromyxobacteria also possess all or some of these capabilities, but appear to utilize non-homolous proteins to mediate the electron transfer steps.  \r\n\r\nComponents of this electron transfer pathway are distributed across both the inner and outer membrane of this gram negative group of organisms. Electrons are first withdrawn from menaquinone via a specialized membrane-anchored tetraheme cytochrome c, named CymA, that belongs to the NapC family.  This menaquinone oxidase is also required for numerous other anaerobic respiratory pathways in Shewanella.  In S. oneidensis MR-1, CymA is also required for the use of various other electron acceptors including fumarate, nitrate, nitrite, and DSMO (PMID: 9023196, PMID: 12899636).  In Shewanella ANA-3 it also required for respiration of arsenate (PMID: 19760266).  A recent study demonstrated that CymA is sufficient to confer soluble Fe-NTA respiratory capability to E. coli (PMID:18394146).\r\n\r\nThe current hypothesis is that electrons are transferred from CymA to a periplasmic decaheme cytochrome c, named MtrA and then to surface localized multi-heme cytochromes.  There is still some speculation as to whether additional electron carriers mediate the transfer of electrons from CymA to MtrA.  In S. oneidensis MR-1, two surface localized decaheme cytochrome c's, MtrC and OmcA, contribute to Fe(III) reduction.  Both are lipoproteins and require the type II secretion system to mediate their translocation across the outer membrane.\r\n\r\nA beta barrel protein, MtrB, is believed to provide passage for MtrA across the outer membrane whereby it can make contact with and transfer electrons to surface bound c-type cytochromes, MtrC and OmcA (PMID: 20002197).\r\n\r\nComparative analysis of 21 sequenced Shewanella reveals that CymA, MtrA, MtrB, and MtrC are conserved in all of the strains that reduce Fe(III) (all but S. denitrificans)(PMID: 18604222).  A second complex (MtrDEF) analogous to MtrCAB is found in some of the strains.  Varying numbers of additional c-type cytochromes, all lipoproteins predicted to localize to the cell surface and some predicted to bind 11 hemes (UndA, UndB), are encoded next to MtrCAB.  The substrate selectivity of these putative surface localized proteins is currently unknown.  Expression of MtrDEF has only been observed in aggregated cells (PMID: 18412550).   \r\n\r\n",

Induces the lysis of other B.subtilis cells that have not entered the sporulation pathway, inducing cannibalism to provide a source of nutrients to support sporulation, and at the same time delaying commitment to the energetically expensive and irreversible onset of sporulation (PubMed:12817086). Addition of SDP to liquid cultures halts growth, leads to increased cell permeability and eventually cell lysis in a significant subset of the population, although some cells survive and resume growth after a lag period (PubMed:20805502). Effects of SDP are irreversible within 10 minutes (PubMed:22469514). Addition of SDP to solid cultures induces killing, it is much more effective than SKF (AC O31422) (PubMed:20805502). Has antibiotic action against Gram-positive Firmicutes (L.acidophilus, M.megaterium, P.polymyxa, S.aureus, S.epidermidis) but not Actinobacteria M.luteus or Gram-negative P.aeruginosa or K.pneumoniae (PubMed:20805502, PubMed:22469514). SDP induces expression of the sdpR-sdpI operon (PubMed:12817086). Its maturation is dependent on SdpA and SdpB.

        "description":"From PMID:25788514 on \"slow porins\" in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species -\r\n\r\n...Organisms such as P. aeruginosa or Acinetobacter species do not produce classical E. coli-type trimeric porins that provide a fast influx of small drugs. The major nonspecific porin in these organisms is a homolog of E. coli OmpA, and its major function is structural, that is, to connect the OM to the underlying peptidoglycan (178). The porin function is produced by the alternative folding of only a small fraction of the protein (perhaps 2% of the population) to produce 16 transmembrane beta-strands, and we proposed to call this class of porins �slow porins,� in order to distinguish them from the classical trimeric porins, in which every molecule produces an open channel (179, 180). Because the number of open channels is small, OM permeability is very low, and beta-lactams cross the OM of P. aeruginosa at a rate 100 times lower than that for the E. coli OM (181, 182). Because of this slow permeation through slow porins, the endogenous RND system MexAB-OprM can compete well with the influx of hydrophilic beta-lactams as well as other antibiotics (Fig. 1). \r\n\r\nP. aeruginosa strains with over-expression of OprD gene showed high sensitivity to carbapenems family antibiotics (PMID:25644798)\r\n\r\nThe outer membrane porin protein D (OprD), a specialized channel-forming protein, responsible for uptake of beta-lactam antibiotics, was identified as sialoglycoprotein.  OprD(-Sias) interacts with beta-lactam antibiotics more than OprD(+Sias) as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance study. Lyposome-swelling assay further exhibited that antibiotics have more capability to penetrate through OprD(-Sias) purified from four clinical isolates of PA (PMID:24643970)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The key components of this outer envelope are mycolic acids. Mycolic acids are the product of two fatty-acid synthase systems present in mycobacteria: mammalian-type fatty-acid synthase I (FAS-I) (Smith et al., 2003) and bacterial-type fatty-acid synthase II (FAS-II) (Takayama et al., 2005; White et al., 2005).\r\n\r\nQuote from PMID:24100560 (paper on Rv0241c): \"Rv0241c or HtdX was first identified in the mycobacterial membrane-associated fraction (Gu et al., 2003) and was eventually identified in the mRNA pool when cultured in the presence of several FAS-II drugs (Boshoff et al., 2004). Recent work on heterologous expression of HtdX has shown that it can participate in the yeast mitochondrial fatty-acid synthetic pathway (Gurvitz et al., 2009) but can only restore the dehydratase activity in Escherichia coli (Sacco et al., 2010). This R-specific beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase is hypothesized to be involved in an alternative or intermediate fatty-acid synthetic pathway required for antibiotic resistance (Kikuchi & Kusaka, 1983; Boshoff et al., 2004; Sacco et al., 2010). Based on the genomic arrangement in Mycobacteria and STRING functional protein association networks, a putative fatty-acid metabolizing operon was identified showing two genes Rv0241c (HtdX) and Rv0242c (FabG4) could be involved in the pathway (Gurvitz, 2009; Dutta et al., 2011).

        "description":"  The glucuronides are then mostly excreted out of the body via the bile ducts into the intestine, through apocrine secretions, and through the bladder into the urinary tract. The conjugated compounds are typically much more water soluble than the respective aglycones and are often biochemically and biologically inactive. The glucuronidation and excretion of such compounds have thus often been described as detoxification.\n  In the intestine and on the skin, large populations of commensal and symbiotic microorganisms have access to the diverse glucuronides, and some have evolved the ability to metabolize these compounds. The enterobacterium Escherichia coli colonizes all known vertebrates. Most E. coli strains living in natural environments possess &#946;-d-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) and are able to acquire glucuronides as nutrients. &#946;-d-Glucuronidase is an intracellular hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of &#946;-d-glucuronides within the cytoplasm of E. coli. The glycone released can then be used as a carbon source. Almost any aglycone conjugated in a hemiacetal linkage to the C-1 hydroxyl of glucuronate in the &#946;-configuration can be cleaved by &#946;-d-glucuronidase, except for some thio-&#946;-d-glucuronides.\n    Some strains of B. subtilis can use glucuronate and galacturonate as primary carbon sources. Polymethylgalacturonate, or pectin, is a constituent of plant cell walls and thus is found in the soil. Extracellular pectate lyases, produced by Erwinia chrysanthemi and many other bacteria, including B. subtilis, convert pectin into oligogalacturonate. Oligogalacturonate can be metabolized into D-galacturonate by enzymes produced by Erwinia sp. In addition, free galacturonate and glucuronate enter Escherichia coli and Erwinia sp. via the exuT transport system. \n  The uxuA, uxuB, uxaA, uxaB, and uxaC genes of E. coli and E. chrysanthemi encode enzymes that degrade intracellular galacturonate and glucuronate into 2-keto 3-deoxygluconate (KDG), which is further metabolized to pyruvate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde. The expression of these genes, including exuT, is negatively regulated by the exuR gene product in these organisms.\n\n \n\n",

These four genes are organized in one transcriptional unit\n The operon is negatively regulated by the kdgR and ccpA gene products, which belong to the LacI family of transcription regulators. The expression of the genes in this operon can be induced by galacturonate and strongly repressed when glucose is present in the growth medium.\n\n-------- The isomerase pathway of D-galacturonic acid (Escherichia coli):----\n\nA bacterial pathway for the catabolism of D-galacturonic acid has been described to be active in E. coli. This pathway consists of five enzymes converting D-galacturonate to \npyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The enzymes in this pathway are uronate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.12) to convert D-galacturonate to D-tagaturonate , NADH-utilising D- tagaturonate reductase (EC 1.1.1.58) to convert D-tagaturonate to D-altronate , altronate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.7) to convert D-altronate to KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate kinase (EC 2.7.1.45) to phosphorylate KDG to KDPG and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14) to convert KDPG to pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The corresponding genes are uxaC, uxaB, uxaA, kdgK and kdgA, respectively. The gene for D-galacturonic acid transport was call  exuT.\n\n---- Oxidative pathway - Uronate dehydrogenase (from ref.10):-------------------\n\nThere are at least three different pathways for the catabolism of D-galacturonate in microorganisms. In the oxidative pathway, which was described in some prokaryotic species, D-galacturonate is first oxidised to meso-galactarate (mucate) by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent dehydrogenase (EC\n1.1.1.203). In the following steps of the pathway mucate is converted to 2-keto-glutarate. The enzyme activities of this catabolic pathway have been described while the corresponding gene sequences are still unidentified.  \n Uronate dehydrogenase, the key enzyme of this pathway, has been investigated in two plant pathogen bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. \n\n\n------- Uid operon - system for uptake and cleavage of glucuronides: ------------\n\n UidB is a proton-dependent transporter specific for &#945;- and &#946;-glucuronides. UidB is essential for glucuronide transport and is located in the inner membrane. UidC is associated with the outer membrane. Although Uid does not confer transport activity, it improves efficiency of transport by UidB by an unknown mechanism. Imported &#946;-glucuronides are cleaved by UidA, an acid glucuronoside glucuronosohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.31) with broad substrate specificity.\n\nUidR is a transcriptional repressor that controls the expression of genes responsible for the utilization of glucuronides. UidR is negatively autoregulated and is sensitive to catabolite control; it contains a helix-turn-helix tetR-type DNA-binding domain.\n\n---- Oxidative pathway - Uronate dehydrogenase (from ref.10):-------------------\n\nThere are at least three different pathways for the catabolism of D-galacturonate in microorganisms. In the oxidative pathway, which was described in some prokaryotic species, D-galacturonate is first oxidised to meso-galactarate (mucate) by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.203).

The enzyme activities of this catabolic pathway have been described while the corresponding gene sequences are still unidentified.  \n Uronate dehydrogenase, the key enzyme of this pathway, has been investigated in two plant pathogen bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. \n\n--------- Pseudomonas pathway - through 5-keto-4-deoxy-uronate: -------\n\nPseudomonas bacteria degrade polygalacturonic acid to the two monosaccharides D-galacturonic acid and 4-Deoxy-5-keto-L-threo-hexuronic acid (ref.9).  \nThe 4-Deoxy-5-keto-L-threo-hexuronic acid was found to be a direct degradation product from polygalacturonic acid and was not derived from D-galacturonic acid, i.e. it is the product \nof pectin-degrading lyases. The ratio of D-galacturonic acid to 4-Deoxy-5-keto-L-threo-hexuronic acid was about 4:1 (Preiss and Ashwell 1963a). For the catabolism of 4-Deoxy- \n5-keto-L-threo-hexuronic acid, a bacterial pathway was suggested for Pseudomonas in which the substrate is first converted to 3-Deoxy-D-glycero-hex-2,5-diulosonic acid by an isomerase. In the next step, 3-Deoxy-D-glycero-hex-2,5-diulosonic acid is reduced by an enzyme which can use NADH as well as NADPH to 3-Deoxy-D-erythro-hex-2-ulosonic acid (KDG) as shown in the \nFig. 5. This is then phosphorylated by an ATP-consuming kinase and subsequently split to pyruvate and D-glyceralde-hyde-3-phospate by an aldolase (Preiss and Ashwell 1963b).\n\nPolygalacturonate lyases which would produce 4-Deoxy-5-keto-L-threo-hexuronate have been reported in the literature for prokaryotic as well as for eukaryotic microorganisms (Jayani et al. 2005). \n\n============REFERENCES:===========================\n\n1a.

Malonate is chemically rather inert, especially at neutral pH, where both carboxylic residues are dissociated (pKa1 = 2.85, pKa2 = 5.69). The dicarboxylate is therefore activated for the decarboxylation reaction by transiently forming a thioester with the enzyme. The catalytically active enzyme carries an acetyl thioester residue that is exchanged in the first partial reaction by a malonyl thioester residue. This is subsequently decarboxylated with regeneration of the acetyl-S-enzyme. It is an acetyl-S-enzyme with an acetylated phosphoribosyl dephospho-CoA prosthetic group. The mdcH gene product acts as a malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase and initiates the activation of (deacetyl)malonate decarboxylase by malonyl-transfer to the prosthetic group. The malonyl residue is subsequently decarboxylated to an acetyl residue by the decarboxylase itself. Purified malonate decarboxylase consists of the four subunits MdcA, D, E and C in an apparent 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry.\r\n",

        "description":"Subsystem under construction \n\nThe major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest known superfamily of secondary carriers found in the biosphere. It is ubiquitously distributed throughout virtually all currently recognized organismal phyla. This superfamily currently (2012) consists of 74 families, each of which is usually concerned with the transport of a certain type of substrate. Many of these families, defined phylogenetically, do not include even a single member that is functionally characterized. (PMID:22458847) \n\nE. coli K-12 contains 70 MFS transporters, 15 of which may be considered drug exporters, as they belong to families 2 and 3 (http://www.membranetransport.org/), which are composed of 12-TMS (transmembrane segment) and 14-TMS members, respectively, of drug/H+ antiporters (37, 130). Most of them, however, are free-standing transporters located in the IM and transport drugs from the cytosol to only the periplasm. Because most antimicrobial agents reach the cytosol usually by diffusion across the membrane bilayer, the pumped- out drug molecules have a good chance of reentering the cytosol through this free-diffusion process, and the transporters of this class are not expected to create high-level resistance (PMID: 25788514).\n\nFor this reason this Subsystem encodes only those MFS pumps, which (i) occur with their own periplasmic adaptor proteins and with OM channels (such as TolC) and presumably produce an efficient tripartite efflux system ((PMID: 25788514) and (ii) are still uncharacterized.  Characterized tripartite efflux systems of the MFS are encoded in separate Subsystems, for example, see: SS: \"Tripartite multidrug efflux systems (of MSF type) EmrKY-TolC and EmrAB-TolC\"\n\nReferences\n\nLi XZ, Plesiat P, Nikaido H. 2015.

This sophisticated complex senses signals from outside the bacterial cell and transmits them via two membranes into the cytoplasm, leading to transcriptional activation of target genes\" (quoted from (Koebnik, 2005))\r\n\r\n\"The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors are small regulatory proteins that are quite divergent in sequence relative to most other sigma factors. Many bacteria, particularly those with more complex genomes, contain multiple ECF sigma factors and these regulators often outnumber all other types of sigma factor combined. Examples include Bacillus subtilis (7 ECF sigma factors), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (10), Caulobacter crescentus (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (approximately 19), and Streptomyces coelicolor (approximately 50). The roles and mechanisms of regulation for these various ECF sigma factors are largely unknown, but significant progress has been made in selected systems. As a general trend, most ECF sigma factors are cotranscribed with one or more negative regulators. Often, these include a transmembrane protein functioning as an anti-sigma factor that binds, and inhibits, the cognate sigma factor. Upon receiving a stimulus from the environment, the sigma factor is released and can bind to RNA polymerase to stimulate transcription\" (quoted from (Helmann, 2002))\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nHelmann JD.  2002.

        "notes":["This pathway recycles the methylthioadenosine back to methionine.  I have included the two major\nsources of methylthioadenosine. \n\nBased primarily on the review and references cited therein:\n\nSekowska, A., Denervaud, V., Ashida, H., Michoud, K., Haas, D., Yokota, A., and Danchin, A.  2004.  Bacterial\nvariations on the methionine salvage pathway.  BMC Microbiol. 4:9 (17 pp).\n\n\nVariant codes:\n0  No diagnosis\n1  MTAN + MTRK and DKMTPPE + HKMTPPP = Bacillus subtilis version\n2  MTAN + MTRK and DKMTPPEP\n3  MTAP and DKMTPPE + HKMTPPP\n4  MTAP and DKMTPPEP\n\nMany eukaryotes seem to have complete pathway except 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene dioxygenase\n(EC 1.13.-.-).  I suggest that this is SIPL (\"submergence induced protein 2A like\"), which is common among eukaryotes,\nhas no assigned function in any of the model organisms (match from B. subtilis to human = 1.2e-12, with 31.78%\nindentity).  This is supported by match to pfam03079, ARD, ARD/ARD' family (defined by the Klebsiella\n1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene dioxygenase).  Also matches COG1791 (called Uncharacterized\nconserved protein).\n\nInterestingly Arabidopsis seems to use MTAN + MTRK instead of MTAP, as found in other eukaryotes.  The gene\nis not of chloroplast origin (cyanobacteria use MTAP).\n\nSeveral enzymes can serve in the final step.  Note:\n\nHeilbronn J, Wilson J, Berger BJ.  1999.  Tyrosine aminotransferase catalyzes the final step of methionine recycling in Klebsiella pneumoniae.\nJ. Bacteriol. 181: 1739-47.\nPMID: 10074065\n\nDetails:\n\nThe two primary sources of methylthioadenosine are spermidine synthesis and N-acyl-homoserine lactone\nsynthesis:\n\nMethylthioadenosine from spermidine synthesis (see Polyamine Metabolism):\n\nMethionine\n   |\n   |  ATP\n   |/\n   |  MetK = S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (EC 2.5.1.6)\n   |\\\n   |  PPi + Pi\n   v\nS-adenosylmethionine\n   |\n   |  SpeD = ytcF = S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme (EC 4.1.1.50)\n   |\\\n   |  CO2\n   v\nS-adenosylmethioninamine\n   |\n   |  Putrescine\n   |/\n   |  SpeE = ywhF = Spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16)\n   |\\\n   |  Spermidine\n   v\nMethylthioadenosine\n\n\nMethylthioadenosine from N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone synthesis:\n\nS-adenosylmethionine\n   |\n   |  Acyl-ACP\n   |/\n   |  rhlL (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), traI (Agrobacterium Ti plasmids), psyI (Pseudomonas syringae), etc.\n   |\\\n   |  N-acyl-homoserine lactone + ACP\n   v\nMethylthioadenosine\n\nWe will confront a significant issue in itemizing all versions of this (all the different acyl chains).

        "description":"Pathogenic mycobacteria require type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport virulence factors across their complex cell envelope. These bacteria have up to five of these systems, termed ESX-1 to ESX-5. This Subsystem encodes locus ESX-2 in all Mycobacterial genomes currently available in the SEED database.\r\n\r\nESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen, is the prototype of a novel family of small proteins (ESX) of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms.  The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has 23 ESX proteins, encoded by genes esxA through esxW, arranged in tandem pairs in 11 genomic loci, known as the ESX or ESAT-6 loci \r\n\r\nExport of ESAT-6 and related proteins requires a dedicated secretory apparatus, variously named ESAT-6- , SNM-, ESX-, or type VII secretion system (Bitter et al., 2009). Components of these secretion machinery are commonly encoded by clusters of genes co-localized with the ESAT-6 (ESX) family proteins. Out of the 11 ESX loci in the genome of M. tuberculosis, five (ESX-1 through ESX-5) include secretion system components.  Among them region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) is believed to be ancestral.  Only the ESX-1 region (corresponding to RD1) is encoded in this SS, please see the following subsystems for loci ESX-2 through ESX-5:\r\n\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-2)\r\n    ...........\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-5)\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes\r\n\r\nConservative gene clusters containing proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative secretion system (SNM) have been identified in other Gram-positive pathogens as well, including Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diptheriae and Listeria monocytogenes (Pallen, 2002).  In Staphylococcus aureus SNM  homologues are required for secretion of ESAT-6-like proteins (Burts et al ., 2005).  As with mycobacteria, loss of ESAT-6 secretion in S. aureus  correlates with reduced virulence.  While the role of these homologues in other Gram(+) species is not yet determined, mounting evidence suggests that this alternative secretion system will be important for virulence in many acid-fast and Gram-positive pathogens. \r\n\r\nGiven its role in pathogenesis, it is curious that the ESAT-6/Esx/SNM secretion system also functions in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. M. smegmatis  has a genetic locus homologous to RD1 and is able to secrete ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homologues (Gey Van Pittius et al .,2001; Converse and Cox, 2005). Interestingly, mutations in M. smegmatis SNM homologues not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (Converse and Cox, 2005), but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (Flint et al ., 2004).  While the SNM pathway may have different functions in various bacteria, similarity of snm  genes suggests that the core mechanism of SNM secretion is conserved. \r\n\r\n",

A recent study suggested that it is a ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reductase rather than an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Furthermore, recent advances in subunit analysis of NDH have revealed the presence of a novel hydrophilic subcomplex on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane, as well as an unexpected lumenal subcomplex (PMID: 21785130)\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.Ifuku K, Endo T, Shikanai T, Aro EM.

Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase has a cyclase subunit (HisEa) and an amidotransferase subunit (His Eb). These steps are followed by ones catalyzed by imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase (HisF), and histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (HisG).  Histidinol-phosphatase (HisH), the next step in the pathway, may have an alternative form (HisH2). The final step of the histidine pathway, histidinol dehydrogenase (HisI) produces L-Histidine.\r\n",

There are clusters in some of these organisms containing an inositol phosphatase \r\n\r\nObservations from Ross Overbeek,\r\nI believe that some of these are, probably,  Histidinol-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.15).\r\n\r\nI mentioned this to Joern Kalinowski who works with Corynebacterium at Bielefeld.  He wrote\r\nback saying that the gene I pointed to in Corynebacterium was not hisH, but\r\n\r\n    \"although the report on the disruption of the impA gene within the his\r\n     gene cluster in Mycobacterium smegmatis did not sound encouraging, some\r\n     of our lab work revealed rather exciting news.\r\n\r\n     We found a histidine-auxotrophic phenotype in Corynebacterium glutamicum\r\n     by deleting an impA paralogous gene (NCgl0765). This gene is most\r\n     probably the missing hisK homolog.\" [at the time of this note we were using hisK to reference\r\n     the histidinol phosphatase]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis led to the HisH2 assignments in this spreadsheet.  However, it is really impossible\r\nwithout some wet lab work to figure out which of the \"inositol phosphatases\" are really\r\nHisH.  I believe that some of the genes that cluster with the histidine biosynthetic genes\r\nare really hisK, although not all of them.  For now, treat the HisK2 calls as quite tentative.\r\n\r\nI recently noticed that a set of phosphatases in Neissseria and Haemophilus that I had annotated\r\nas hisK were really involved in cell-wall synthesis.\r\n\r\nThe whole hisH hisH2 question needs wet lab work.  I have tried to call the hisH2s, but the\r\ninositol monophosphatase family will have to be carefully disambuated in the wet lab.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is worth noting that in the Enterobacteriales \r\n\r\n         6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44)\r\n\r\nappears to cluster with Histidine Biosynthesis, although often clearly not on the same strand.  The conjecture\r\nwould be that the region of DNA is co-regulated (unwrapped?), and that the conversion  of 6-phospho-gluconate to rubulose-5-phosphate is co-regulated.

        "description":"Three groups of glutathione-dependent enzymes are included in this Subsystem:\r\n\r\n- Glutathione S-transferases - major phase II detoxification enzymes;\r\n- Glyoxalases I and II of the glutathione-dependent pathway of methylglyoxal detoxification;\r\n- Phytochelatin synthases - key enzymes for heavy-metal detoxification in plants (and some prokaryotes)\r\n\r\nI.  The glutathione transferases (also known as glutathione S-transferases) are major phase II detoxification enzymes.  In addition to their role in catalyzing the conjugation of electrophilic substrates to glutathione (GSH), these enzymes also carry out a range of other functions. They have peroxidase and isomerase activities, and can bind non-catalytically a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands.   Cytosolic GSTs of mammals have been particularly well characterized, and were originally classified into Alpha, Mu, Pi and Theta classes.  Currently the GST superfamily is being subdivided further into an ever-increasing number of classes based on a variety of criteria, including amino acid\\nucleotide sequence, and immunological, kinetic and tertiary\\quaternary structural properties.   Moreover, several novel classes identified in non-mammalian species have been subsequently identified in mammals, sometimes carrying out functions not previously associated with GSTs.  For example, Zeta-class GST was determined to be identical with maleylacetate isomerase, an enzyme of the catabolic pathway for tyrosine \r\n\r\nII.  Lactoylglutathione lyase (EC 4.4.1.5) and Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.6) (also called glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II) catalyze the two sequential reactions of the glutathione-dependent pathway of methylglyoxal detoxification. Glyoxalase I is a metalloisomerase that converts the  non-enzymically formed Methylglyoxal�GSH hemithioacetal adduct into the corresponding thioester. This  product is subsequently hydrolysed by glyoxalase II, generating D-lactate and  regenerating GSH.  See Subsystem \"Methylglyoxal_Metabolism\" for details. Notably, two characterized SAM-dependent methyltransferase protein families cluster tightly with glyoxalase II in the majority of microorganisms\r\n\r\nIII.  Phytochelatins (PCs) are known to be the main heavy-metal- detoxifying peptides in the plant kingdom (1).  PCs are glutathione (GSH)-derived peptides of the general formula (gamma-Glu-Cys)nGly (with n= 2�11), which have been identified in a wide variety of plant species and in some microorganisms.  They act as heavy metal (mainly Cd2+chelators and favor their vacuolar sequestration.  \r\nPCs are synthesized posttranslationally in the presence of heavy-metal ions by the PC synthase, a gamma-glutamyl-cysteine transpeptidase.  This enzyme can also hydrolyze GSH and GS-conjugated xenobiotics.  Genes encoding PCS have been isolated and characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPCS1), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpPCS), and wheat (Triticum aestivum; TaPCS1), but also in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (CePCS1) and cyanobacteria (Rea, 2006; Vivares et al., 2005: Harada, et al., 2004). In the cyanobacterium Nostoc, the enzyme (NsPCS) contains only the catalytic domain of the eukaryotic synthase and can act as a GSH hydrolase and weakly as a peptide ligase.\r\n",

In a number of such cases erroneous over-annotation of glutathione-dependent enzyme(s) can�t be ruled out.  However, in genera Streptococcus and Haemophilus this is not the case, since clear orthologs of Lactoylglutathione lyase and Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase are present in ALL sequenced genomes, while only some of them contain bifunctional glutathione biosynthesis gene gshF.  The source of glutathione in those that don�t - is a mystery.  For example, only S. agalactiae and S. mutans are capable of GSH biosynthesis, while S. equi, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes lack this gene.

        "description":"Anaerobic bacteria like clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (R)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which is dehydrated to enoyl-CoA by syn-elimination.This reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pK 40-50). A mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. The 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component A, an activator, and component D, the actual dehydratase. Component A, a homodimer with one [4Fe-4S]cluster, transfers an electron to component D, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe-4S]clusters and FMN, concomitant with hydrolysis of two ATP. From component D the electron is further transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. In the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pK14). After elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of ATP. The helix-cluster-helix architecture of component A forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of ATP resembling an archer shooting arrows (archerases).\r\n",

A relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases is benzoyl-CoA reductase from Thauera aromatica. Analogous but unrelated archerases are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. In anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven electron transfer from NADH to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component A, has been established. The transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical Na(+)-gradient. This enzyme is related to the Rnf proteins involved in Rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation\r\n"],

        "description":"A novel transporter responsible for uptake of ferrous iron under conditions of iron limitation and low pH (cryptic in E. coli lab strains, but active in E.coli O157:H7).\r\n\r\nThe predominant environmental form of iron is the poorly soluble ferric form (10-18 M at pH 7.0).  Relatively soluble (0.1 M at pH 7.0) ferrous iron is mainly restricted to anaerobic/microaerobic niches or low pH  environments. Low solubility of ferric iron leads to problems of poor bioavailability. In addition, iron can cause toxicity in the presence of oxygen due to its tendency to engage in Fenton chemistry generating highly-reactive free-radical species. Consequently, organisms have developed various strategies that allow them to acquire sufficient iron for growth whilst avoiding any deleterious effects caused by iron toxicity (e.g. siderophore-dependent transporters)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to ferric iron (Fe3+), ferrous iron (Fe2+) can be directly imported using FeoAB transporters, which are thought to function under anaerobic-microaerophilic conditions.  In addition, metal-type ABC transporters [e.g. SitABCD of Salmonella typhimurium] and NRAMP-like transporters [e.g. MntH of Escherichia coli] also can translocate Fe2+.  \r\n\r\nRecently, a new type of ferrous-iron transporter, designated EfeUOB, has been identi&#64257;ed in E. coli.  It consists of three protein components (EfeUOB) and acts mainly at low pH (Cao et al. 2007).  Homologous systems are present in many other bacteria. The efeUOB operon is induced at low pH upon phosphorylation of the CpxR component of the CpxAR two-component response regulator (for copper). Expression increases in response to iron-depleted conditions in a Fe2+-Fur (Iron Uptake Regulator)-dependent manner. Also repressed by luxS. Since these regulators play roles elsewhere in the cell, and are part of other subsystems, I will not include them in this one. \r\n\r\nIn some Streptococci, the efe operon is interrupted by remnants of a transposase, indicating an insertion event.\r\n",

        "description":"ESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen (9), is the prototype of a novel Esat-6/Esx family of small proteins of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms, many of them pathogenic (4, 7, 10).  The biochemical function of these proteins is still unclear, but their prominent role in virulence has been documented in Mycobacteria (reviewed in 1) and recently � in Staphylococcus aureus (3).  \r\nAll ESAT-6 family proteins lack known secretion signals, and their export requires novel secretory apparatus, which is encoded by a cluster of genes co-localized with ESAT-6 family proteins.  It was originally identified by bioinformatics analysis (4, 10) and later experimentally confirmed (reviewed in 2).  The genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and other Mycobacterial species has five copies of this cluster known as the ESAT-6 loci, with the region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) believed to be ancestral (5).  Orthologs of region 4 are also found in genomes of Corynebacteria, Streptomyces, Brevibacterium, and other Actinobacteria (5).\r\n\r\nConservative gene clusters encoding proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative cognate secretion system have been identified in genomes of other Gram-positive pathogens as well as, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, and Listeria monocytogenes (7).  Although the level of sequence similarity between mycobacterial ESAT-6 homologs and their analogs in Firmicutes (EssxAB/YukE proteins) is very low, their inclusion in a single ESAT-6 superfamily is based on (i) conservation of the WXG motif, (ii) the protein length of ~100 AA, and � most importantly -- (iii) a tendency of the corresponding genes to cluster with other ESAT-6 family members as well as with EssC/YukA proteins � membrane-bound ATPases possessing two or more FtsK/SpoIIIE domains (7).  Single copies of this domain, containing ATP_binding motif, are found in the FtsK cell division protein from E. coli and in the SpoIIIE  sporulation protein from B. subtilis, where they  are thought to be involved in DNA  translocation.  However, this domain is a specific example of the more general  AAA+ domain (6), common to many ATPases involved in macromolecular  secretion, including those from Gram-negative type IV protein secretion  systems (7). \r\nThe clustering of the ESAT-6 and the FtsK/SpoIIIE family proteins (the �minimal ESAT-6 cluster�), preserved almost invariably in all species (i) gives credibility to categorizing the distant ESAT-6 homologs as one family and (ii) identifies the FtsK/SpoIIIE family as the most conserved (and likely most important) component of the cognate secretion system (7).  Indeed, the essential role of the FtsK/SpoIIIE family proteins in the secretion of ESAT-6-homologs (and in virulence) has been demonstrated experimentally in Mycobacteria (reviewed in 2) and in S. aureus (3).  Notably, other genes within the ESAT-6 cluster differ between mycobacteria (see SS: �ESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Actinobacteria�) and Firmicutes (see SS: �ESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes�), yet their involvement in ESAT-6 secretion has been documented in each system (2, 3).  The differences between the components of this novel Gram(+) secretion system in diverse species may indicate adaptations to different effector molecules.  \r\n\r\nNotably, mutations in ESAT-6 cluster in M. smegmatis not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (11).  Furthermore, the YueB protein, a B. subtilis homolog of the �putative secretion accessory protein EsaA� has been identified as the bacteriophage SPP1 receptor (8), leading the authors to speculate that membrane products of the ESAT-6 operon (YueB, YukC, and YukA) �could form a complex required for channeling the ejected DNA through the membrane.\"\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n1.

CmeABC is constitutively expressed in wild-type Campylobacter strains and extrudes a broad range of antibiotics (including fluoroquinolones), dyes, heavy metals, bile salts and detergents.7�9 This efflux system is a key player for intrinsic antibiotic resistance and is also required for the acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones. In addition, CmeABC is essential for Campylobacter colonization in vivo by mediating resistance to bile, which is normally present in the intestinal tract of animals.11 CmeABC is controlled by CmeR,12 a transcriptional repressor encoded by a gene located immediately upstream of cmeABC (PMID:16303882)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n",

        "description":"Interconversions of 2-ketoglutarate and glutamate are a major link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism in all living organisms.  These reactions are catalyzed by several enzymes: \r\n\r\n- glutamate dehydrogenase [2-ketoglutarate + NAD(P)H + NH3 + H+ &#8592;&#8594; L-glutamate + H2O +NAD(P)+], \r\n- glutamate synthase [2-ketoglutarate + L-glutamine + NAD(P)H &#8592;&#8594; 2x glutamate +NAD(P)H], \r\n- and glutamate aminotransferases [2-ketoglutarate + amino acid &#8592;&#8594; glutamate + keto acid]\r\n\r\nThis subsystem encodes only L-glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH).  In general, GDHs fall into three classes based on their coenzyme specificity and their physiological function.  NAD-dependent GDH (EC 1.4.1.2) is mainly involved in 2-oxoglutarate production (glutamate catabolism) and NADP-dependent GDH (EC 1.4.1.4) - in glutamate production (ammonia assimilation) in microorganisms.  The GluDH that has dual coenzyme NAD(P)H specificity (EC 1.4.1.3) have been documented in the mammalian tissues, as well as in several microbial species, e.g. in Bacteroides fragilis (Abrahams et al., 1998), Sulfolobus solfataricus (Consalvi et al., 1991), and others.  \r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in this SS to disambiguate L-glutamate dehydrogenases in regards to their cofactor specificity.  GDH enzymes have been isolated and characterized in detail in a number of different microbial species � such proteins are associated with the corresponding references (as DLITs) in SEED.  These annotations, as well as GDH annotations in closely related genomes are �locked�.   \r\nFrom these reference sequences cofactor specificity (NAD+, NADPH, or both) was projected to GDH proteins in taxonomically related organisms.  However, the results of this attempted projection should be taken very cautiously, since large differences in NAD//NADP preference are often determined by changes in merely a few amino acid residues (e.g., Kujo et al., 1999)\r\n\r\nIn cases when cofactor specificity could not be reliably predicted from protein sequence, both functional annotation are associated with a protein (separated with a semicolon [;]) - \r\n�NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.2) ; NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.4)�\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the enzymes that have been experimentally shown to have dual cofactor NAD(P)H specificity are annotated here as �NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.2) / NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.4)� with a slash [/]  (this annotation has replaced EC 1.4.1.3 referring to dual specificity)\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.

Betaine lipids are abundant in many eukaryotes such as nonseed plants, algae, fungi, and amoeba. Some of these organisms are entirely devoid of phosphatidylcholine and, instead, contain a betaine lipid such as diacylglyceryl-O-4'-(N,N,N,-trimethyl)homoserine. Recently, this lipid also was discovered in the photosynthetic purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides where it seems to replace phosphatidylcholine under phosphate-limiting growth conditions. This discovery provided the opportunity to study the biosynthesis of betaine lipids in a bacterial model system. Mutants of R. sphaeroides deficient in the biosynthesis of the betaine lipid were isolated, and two genes essential for this process, btaA and btaB, were identified. It is proposed that btaA encodes an S-adenosylmethionine:diacylglycerol 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferase and btaB an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent N-methyltransferase. Both enzymatic activities can account for all reactions of betaine lipid head group biosynthesis. Because the equivalent reactions have been proposed for different eukaryotes, it seems likely that orthologs of btaA/btaB may be present in other betaine lipid-containing organisms.\r\nPMID: 11331765\r\n",

J Bacteriol. 2009 Jul;191(14):4594-604\r\n    \r\nPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B728a is known to produce the siderophore pyoverdine under iron-limited conditions. It has also been proposed that this pathovar has the ability to produce a second siderophore, achromobactin. Here we present genetic and biochemical evidence supporting the hypothesis that P. syringae pv. syringae B728a produces both of these siderophores. We show that strains unable to synthesize either pyoverdine or achromobactin are unable to grow under iron-limiting conditions, which is consistent with these two molecules being the only siderophores synthesized by P. syringae pv. syringae B728a. Enzymes associated with achromobactin biosynthesis were purified and analyzed for substrate recognition. We showed that AcsD, AcsA, and AcsC together are able to condense citrate, ethanolamine, 2,4-diaminobutyrate, and alpha-ketoglutarate into achromobactin. Replacement of ethanolamine with ethylene diamine or 1,3-diaminopropane in these reactions resulted in the formation of achromobactin analogs that were biologically active. This work provides insights into the biosynthetic steps in the formation of achromobactin and is the first in vitro reconstitution of achromobactin biosynthesis.    PMID: 19482931\r\n"],

        "description":"Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics can be achieved by any of three strategies: \r\n- the production of beta-lactam-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase enzymes, \r\n- the utilization of beta-lactam-insensitive cell wall transpeptidases, \r\n- active expulsion of beta-lactam molecules from Gram-negative cells by way of efflux pumps\r\n- and loss of porins.\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem captures only beta-lactam-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase enzymes of the Ambler class A.\r\nOther classes of beta-lactamases are encoded in the following Subsystems:\r\n   -- Beta-lactamases Ambler class A\r\n   -- Beta-lactamases Ambler class C\r\n   -- Beta-lactamases Ambler class D\r\n\r\nQuoted from van Hoek et al., 2011:\r\nThe &#946;-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting the cell wall synthesis by binding to so-called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria and interfering with the structural cross linking of peptidoglycans and as such preventing terminal transpeptidation in the bacterial cell wall. As a consequence it weakens the cell wall of the bacterium and finally results in cytolysis or death due to osmotic pressure (Kotra and Mobashery, 1998; Andes and Craig, 2005).\r\n\r\nQuoted from Koch AL, 2000:\r\n  \"It is with very little difficulty that the genes for penicillin-binding proteins can be slightly modified (a few point mutations) to let water into the active site and turn a transpeptidase into a hydrolase.  Hydrolysis of the antibiotic is a path chemically similar to its action on a muropeptide and would quickly destroy the four-membered strained ring compound and could occur at high rate.\r\nBecause this is similar to the transpeptidase action needed for sacculus expansion, with just a few changes, a functional PBP for growth could have been duplicated and one copy turned from a transpeptidase into a D,D- hydrolase (&#946;-lactamase). Considering how easy this is theoretically, one is not surprised that this has happened many times and in many ways and in many lines of descent.\r\n\r\n...The available amino acid sequences provide evidence that make it is clear that the lactamases came from a PBP and did not arise independently...  The amino acid sequences of the genes for this large family of penicillin-recognizing enzymes: the PBPs per se, penicillin-sensing proteins, and &#946;-lactamases have several highly conserved sequences of amino acid (Figure 5).  It is clear that all the proteins together form a super family.\"\r\n",

The Stickland reaction involves one amino acid which acts as an electron donor while another acts as an electron acceptor. However, L-ornithine, as a single substrate, is converted into both an electron donor and acceptor and metabolized in a way similar to the Stickland reaction: it is oxidized to acetate, alanine, and ammonia (oxidative pathway) and reduced to 5-aminovalerate through the formation of proline (reductive pathway). \r\n\r\nThe oxidative pathway starts with the conversion of L-ornithine to the D-isomer by ornithine racemase (OR) (EC 5.1.1.12). D-Ornithine is next converted to (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoate (DAP) through the action of D-ornithine aminomutase (OA) (EC 5.4.3.5). DAP then undergoes a NAD+- or NADP+-dependent oxidative deamination by DAP dehydrogenase (DAPDH) (EC 1.4.1.12) leading to 2-amino-4-ketopentanoate (AKP).

Siderophore synthesis is typically controlled by extracellular iron abundance, and these molecules display a high affinity for ferric iron. Four types of structurally distinct molecules are thought to be involved in iron acquisition in mycobacteria, salicylic acid and citric acid being the simplest, followed by two classes of more complex siderophores. The first, the mycobactins (MBs), are distinguished primarily by the presence of a phenyloxazolidine ring, while the second class, the exochelins, are peptidic siderophores whose iron-chelating ability is associated with ornithine-derived hydroxamates. MBs and exochelins are complex molecules with very high affinities for iron and are integral to the bacterial strategy for obtaining iron from the environment.\r\n",

        "subsystem_id":"High_affinity_phosphate_transporter_and_control_of_PHO_regulon",
        "description":"Inorganic phosphate (Pi), the preferred source of phosphorus, is often limiting in the environment.  Multiple genes induced under Pi limiting conditions comprise the PHO operon.  These genes are coregulated by extra-cellular phosphate and are likely all involved in phosphorus assimilation (Wanner, 1993). \r\n\r\nThe signal transduction pathway required for the regulation of the PHO regulon has been analyzed in great detail in E. coli and related bacteria (Wanner, 1993, Wanner, 1996; van Veen, 1997; White, 2000).  Its components required for regulation are: (i) PstS, a periplasmic Pi binding protein, (ii) PstACB � high-affinity inner membrane Pi uptake ABC transporter, (iii) PhoU  (iv) histidine kinase PhoR, response regulator PhoB.  Repression of PHO regulon under conditions of Pi excess (above 4 microM) requires the PstSABC system, PhoU, and PhoR. Induction of PHO regulon under Pi-limiting conditions requires PhoR and PhoB. \r\n\r\nModel for the PHO regulation according to (Wanner, 1993, Wanner, 1996):   \r\nWhen Pi is available in access, the Pi-PstS in the periplasm binds to the PstABC transporter in the membrane. A �repressor� complex forms between Pi-PstS, PstABC, PhoU, and PhoR. PhoR within the complex acts a phosphatase and maintains PhoB in the dephosphorylated state.  When Pi becomes limiting, PhoR is released from the repressor complex, autophosphorylates, and then phosphorylates PhoB.  Phosphorylated PhoB is a positive transcription regulator for the PHO regulon.  \r\n\r\nIn GramPositive microorganisms, regulatory circuit(s) induced by limiting Pi is less understood.   For example, in B. subtilis at least three global regulatory systems are responsible for changes in gene expression upon phosphate deprivation (Paul et al., 2004).  One set of genes is controlled either positively or negatively by the PhoP-PhoR two-component regulators, genes referred to as the Pho regulon genes (for review, Hulett, 2002).  Other genes that are induced upon phosphate limitation are dependent on SigB, an alternative stress sigma factor.  A third class of genes is expressed under phosphate-limiting growth conditions that are independent of either SigB or PhoP-PhoR (Antelmann, et al., 2000).  The regulatory coordination between these three sets of genes is unclear (Paul et al., 2004).\r\n\r\nPho regulon genes are the most extensively studied set of phosphate-regulated genes in B. subtilis.  A high-affinity Pi transport system (PstS system) is directly induced for the uptake of inorganic phosphate, while a family of alkaline phosphatases, PhoA, PhoB, and PhoD, are secreted whose activity may function to supply the decreasing Pi pool.  Anionic cell wall polymer turnover (Archibald et al., 1993) is controlled by PhoP-PhoR, as phosphorylated PhoP (PhoP~P) directly represses tag genes that are required for synthesis of the high-phosphate anionic polymer, teichoic acid, and activates the tua genes responsible for synthesis of a non-phosphate-containing polymer, teichuronic acid, under phosphate-limiting conditions.   Hence, B. subtilis �carries its phosphate reserve on its back�, as teichoic acid is turned over as the teichuronic acid replaces it. The secreted phosphodiesterases and phosphomonoesterases, PhoD, PhoB, and PhoA, are believed to have a role in the teichoic acid degradation, providing an additional phosphate supply for uptake via the PstS high-affinity transport system (Paul et al., 2004).\r\n\r\n",

        "description":"Proline.\nThe main route of Proline catabolism in bacteria and eukaryotes is via transformation to L-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C, catalyzed by Proline dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.8)), which in turn is oxidized to L-glutamate (catalyzed by Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.12)).  Both enzymatic activities reside in a bifunctional protein PutA in the majority of microorganisms.  In addition to its enzymatic activities, the PutA protein acts as a repressor of putA and putP expression in response to proline supply in the majority of Gamma-Proteobacteria.  DNA-binding activity resides in an additional ~50 aa N-terminal domain present in PutA in these organisms. \n\nAlternative route of proline catabolism, in which Proline is converted to 5-aminovaleriate has been described in Clostridia.  The process is catalyzed by a multi-subunit selenocysteine-containing Proline reductase (EC 1.21.4.1).  Proline racemese (located in the same cluster) ensures utilization of either L- or D-Pro.\n\nPotentially Proline might also be utilized by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (ProC, EC 1.5.1.2).   However, this enzyme preferentially acts in the biosynthesis of Pro (Kenklies et al. 1999), even though the reaction is reversible in some cases.\n\nProline transporters\nProline transporters are NOT encoded comprehensively in this SS.  The ProP and ProY have been included tentatively; however, see Dr. Laszlo Csonka�s comments below:\n(i)\tProP can take up proline but for some reason (that could be very interesting), the proline that comes in through ProP cannot be used for catabolism by PrDH/P5CDH  (PutA).  ProP can take up proline as precursor for protein synthesis and as an osmoprotectant (along with glycine betaine), but not for use as a carbon or nitrogen source.\n(ii)\tProY was found by Stanley Maloy via a mutation that suppressed  PutP mutations.   However in the wild-type, it does not take up proline.  I don't know whether the suppressor mutation was ever determined by sequencing, but it has been suggested that the mutation increases the expression of ProY.  There is a very good chance that the real substrate for ProY is not proline and that it may be annotated as a proline transporter in other organisms only because of sequence similarity to the E. coli ProY.\n\n\n4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp).\nThe 4-hydroxyproline (4-Hyp) is present in large quantities in collagen and (to a lesser extend) in other animal proteins.  It is present in all plants studied - from algae to angiosperms, in both - insoluble cell wall-bound proteins, and in soluble proteins, among them - in potato lectin, a soluble protein from Sandal, and other proteins present in cell sap or released into the medium of cultured cells.  Most or all of the 4-Hyp residues in plant proteins are linked glycosidically through the Hyp hydroxyl to arabinose oligosaccharides, with one to four residues in furanosyl beta-linkage [1 -> 2 or 1 -> 3] (Koo and Adams, 1980).  4-Hyp is produced exclusively by post-translational hydroxylation of appropriate Pro residues, catalyzed by Peptidyl prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Pihlajaniemi et al., 1987; Helaakoski et al., 1994).  Thus, 4-Hyp released by protein breakdown and subsequent hydrolysis of 4-Hyp-containing peptides cannot be directly reutilized for protein synthesis, and is committed to excretion or catabolism.\n\nIt is noteworthy, that even though 4-hydroxyproline apparently does not occur in structural components of bacterial cells (is present, however, in some antibiotics, e.g. etamycin, actinomycin), close homologs of Peptidyl prolyl 4-hydroxylase is detectable in a limited number of microbial species, including cyanobacteria, pathogenic Bacilli, Xantomonas, several marine organisms.  Their function is enigmatic, their sporadic phylogenetic distribution points to potential horizontal transfer events (SG).\n\nIn animals the main route of 4-Hyp catabolism is catalyzed by the same enzymes as that of Proline (proline oxidase and hydroxyproline oxidase), yielding in case of 4-Hyp -- delta 1-pyrroline-3-hydroxy-5-carboxylate, converted further to 4-Hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate, and ultimately to glyoxylate and pyruvate. \n\nA different route is under investigation in bacteria.  This proposed inducible catabolic pathway for 4-Hyp proceeds via cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline and results in alpha-ketoglutarate semialdehyde (KGSA).  A very interesting study of Ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, catalyzing the final step in this pathway (conversion of KGSA to alpha-ketoglutarate), present as multiple isozymes in many microbial species, has been published recently (Watanabe et al., 2007).  Not all the genes required for this proposed pathway have been identified yet.  One of them (potentially encoding 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.22)) has been predicted in this Subsystem, based on it�s co-localization with known genes of the pathway. Two other hypothetical genes (abbreviated as Hyp2 and Hyp3 in this SS) are likely to be associated with this pathway, based on functional coupling data (RossO).\n\nReferences\n\nElijah Adams and Leonard Frank. 1980.

        "description":"Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics can be achieved by any of three strategies: \r\n- the production of beta-lactam-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase enzymes, \r\n- the utilization of beta-lactam-insensitive cell wall transpeptidases, \r\n- active expulsion of beta-lactam molecules from Gram-negative cells by way of efflux pumps\r\n- and loss of porins.\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem captures beta-lactam-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase enzymes of the Ambler class D only\r\nOther classes of beta-lactamases are encoded in the following Subsystems:\r\n   -- Beta-lactamases Ambler class A\r\n   -- Beta-lactamases Ambler class B\r\n   -- Beta-lactamases Ambler class C\r\n\r\nQuoted from van Hoek et al., 2011:\r\nThe &#946;-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting the cell wall synthesis by binding to so-called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria and interfering with the structural cross linking of peptidoglycans and as such preventing terminal transpeptidation in the bacterial cell wall. As a consequence it weakens the cell wall of the bacterium and finally results in cytolysis or death due to osmotic pressure (Kotra and Mobashery, 1998; Andes and Craig, 2005).\r\n\r\nQuoted from Koch AL, 2000:\r\n  \"It is with very little difficulty that the genes for penicillin-binding proteins can be slightly modified (a few point mutations) to let water into the active site and turn a transpeptidase into a hydrolase.  Hydrolysis of the antibiotic is a path chemically similar to its action on a muropeptide and would quickly destroy the four-membered strained ring compound and could occur at high rate.\r\nBecause this is similar to the transpeptidase action needed for sacculus expansion, with just a few changes, a functional PBP for growth could have been duplicated and one copy turned from a transpeptidase into a D,D- hydrolase (&#946;-lactamase). Considering how easy this is theoretically, one is not surprised that this has happened many times and in many ways and in many lines of descent.\r\n\r\n...The available amino acid sequences provide evidence that make it is clear that the lactamases came from a PBP and did not arise independently...  The amino acid sequences of the genes for this large family of penicillin-recognizing enzymes: the PBPs per se, penicillin-sensing proteins, and &#946;-lactamases have several highly conserved sequences of amino acid (Figure 5).  It is clear that all the proteins together form a super family.\"\r\n",

        "notes":["OLD NOTES copied from earlier versions of this SS -\r\n\r\nPredictions: \r\nMJ0699 is alternative archaeal deaminase based on clustering (see below)\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\nAn introduction to a subsystem:\r\n(From a web-supplement for a review of Osterman&Overbeek in Current Opinion in Chemical \r\nBiology 2003, 7:238�251)\r\n\r\nRiboflavin biosynthesis.  Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is an ultimate precursor in the \r\nbiosynthesis of the universal and indispensable flavonoid red-ox cofactors: flavin \r\nmononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).  Many aspects of riboflavin/FMN/FAD \r\nbiosynthesis (see a simplified diagram) are largely conserved across all taxons (for \r\nthe recent review see [80]).  The most significant variations occur in archaea, where \r\nsome homologous and non-homologous forms of previously known enzymes have already \r\nbeen characterized [81-83], but a number of enzymatic steps are still associated \r\nwith missing genes.  In a recent study, an alternative two-step transformation (via \r\na hypothesized GTP cyclohydrolase III and nucleotide triphosphate pyrophosphatase) \r\nwas proposed [81] instead of the established one-step reaction of GTP-cyclohydrolase \r\nII characteristic of bacteria, fungi and plants.  Another remarkable variation is \r\nthe flipped order of the pyrimidine deaminase and reductase steps in eukaryotes and \r\narchaea, compared to the standard bacterial biosynthetic route.  Both, fungi and \r\narchaea contain a monofunctional reductase, homologous to a corresponding domain \r\nof the bi-functional protein (encoded by ribD gene) characteristic of most bacteria.  \r\nA monofunctional and non-orthologous eukaryotic deaminase (Pyr_Da) was identified \r\nand characterized, while its archaeal counterpart remains a missing gene.  Analysis \r\nof chromosomal gene clustering in archaea reveals a strong candidate gene for this \r\nfunctional role.  Orthologs of this gene (e.g., MJ0699 in M. jannaschii) are both \r\ndistantly related to guanosine deaminase and largely conserved in archaea.  Initial \r\nexperiments did not provide verification of the expected enzymatic activity of this \r\nand several other candidates [81].  In view of the overwhelming genomic evidence \r\navailable today, the effort to confirm this conjecture is likely to be continued. \r\n\t\r\nFor a long time regulatory elements and mechanisms in riboflavin biosynthesis remained \r\ncompletely obscure.  Early experimental work in B.subtilis, and a comparative cross-genome \r\nanalysis suggested that an upstream element adjacent to the rib-operon (termed RFN) \r\nmay fold into a conserved RNA secondary structure involved with a termination/anti-termination \r\nregulatory mechanism [84,108].  These observations and the experimental data on riboflavin \r\noverproduction in B.subtilis flavokinase mutants [109,110] led to the hypothesis \r\nthat this regulation is mediated directly by FMN [84].  The first direct experimental \r\nverification of these and other predicted RFN regulatory features was recently published \r\n[85,86].  Search for additional occurrences of RFN-like sequences produced a potentially \r\nco-regulated gene (ypaA) in B.subtilis encoding a putative membrane protein of unknown \r\nfunction.  This protein was predicted to be a missing riboflavin transporter, and \r\nexperimental evidence supporting this assignment was obtained later [87].  Encouraged \r\nby this successful prediction, the same group recently published an extended comparative \r\nanalysis of riboflavin biosynthetic genes in a broad range of bacterial genomes basing \r\ntheir analysis on a combination of chromosomal clustering and shared regulatory sites \r\ntechniques [50].  They proposed the existence of two distinct mechanisms of RFN-mediated \r\nregulation, and additionally implicated several uncharacterized proteins in various \r\nspecies as alternative riboflavin transporters. \r\n\r\nVARIANT CODES (simplified as per description of A and B).\r\nNumbers and characters after the dot reflect alternative gene forms and alternative routes (eg in archaea and bacteria).\r\nTwo genes are notoriously missing: Pyrimidine phosphatase and FMNAT in archaea.\r\n\r\n\r\n50.

        "description":"The Chlamydiales include intracellular pathogens that pass through several developmental stages. Elementary bodies (EB), released from lysed host cells, are extracellular infectious entities that gain entry to new host cells and progress to an intracellular developmental stage of replicative capabilities.  These reticulate bodies (RB) initiate a stage of high metabolic activity, and cell populations increase until the host cell resources are depleted. Transformation back to the EB stage then occurs prior to host cell lysis.  Members of Chlamydiales can respond to the host defense mechanisms via progression to an alternative developmental state called �persistence�.  Inclusion membrane proteins (IMP) have been implicated in the morphogenesis that attends the transition to persistence in some Chlamydiales like Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctra), an obligate intracellular pathogen.  IMPs  are thought to have important functions such as nutrient transport and prevention of lysosomal fusions as reviewed by �Lo et el.  2012.  In this paper the main focus is on the importance of tryptophan (TRP) residue content in proteins. Both zero Trp content and high TRP content are explored and both serve a purpose within the infectious abilities of the Chlamydial organism.  Within the 50 IMP examined in the following publication, most are of average TRP content, some have zero Trp and others have high Trp.  \r\n\r\nInclusion membrane proteins have been identified by �Li. Et al.  2008.  Chlamydial infection begins with the entry of elementary bodies (EB) (the infectious form) into the host by endocytosis.  Internalized EBs rapidly differentiate within the endosomal vacuole into reticulate bodies (RB), the metabolically active, but noninfectious form of chlamydial organisms.  After numerous rounds of replication, RBs can then differentiate back into EBs and spread to other adjacent cells.  Chlamydia trachomatis accomplish their biosynthesis, replication and differentiation within the cytoplasmic vacuole (termed inclusion).  Inclusion membranes serve as both a barrier for protection of the intravascular organism and as a gate for interactions with the host cells.  The Chlamydial organism imports nutrients and metabolic intermediates from the host cell and secrets Chlamydial factors into the host cell.  The mechanisms for this exchange across inclusion membranes are largely unknown and Chlamydial IMPs have become an area of intensive investigations. In this paper, the authors have isolated 50 proposed inclusion membrane protein, which they have divided into three groups.  22 of them were localized to the inclusion membrane, seven are isolated as Intrainclusions, and the remaining 21 are as yet undefined.\r\n\r\nInclusion membrane proteins have also been examined for Protochlamydia amoeophila, a chlamydial endosymbiont of free-living amoebae.  Of the 23 identified putative inclusion membrane proteins, four were localized to the inclusion membrane, as described by Heinz et al.\r\n\r\n\"Lo et el.  2012.

        "description":"Ethambutol [dextro-2,29-(ethylenediimino)-di-1-butanol] was introduced in 1961 and is a first-line anti-TB agent used in drug combinations to prevent the emergence of drug resistance (PMID: 26033726).  ETB interferes with mycobacterial cell wall synthesis and integrity by inhibiting arabinosyl transferases encoded by the embCAB locus (10 kb), which encompasses three contiguous genes, embC, embA, and embB (PMID: 8876238; PMID: 9142129).  These enzymes are essential for the synthesis of arabinogalactan (EmbA and EmbB) and lipoarabinomannan (EmbC) in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates (PMID: 26033726)\n\nThe majority of the detected mutations conveying Ethambutol resistance are concentrated in a 576-bp region of embB, called the ETB resistance-determining region (PMID:10639358; PMID:21444710; PMID:26033726). This region includes codons 306, 406, and 497 and is predicted to be the recognition site of the enzyme EmbB (PMID: 14507364).  However, a small fraction of mutations map to in the embC-embA intergenic region (PMID: 26033726) or to embR, the transcriptional activator of this locus, reported to be involved in ETB resistance (PMID: 10639358)\n\n\n1. Organisms antibiotic is used against:  Mycobacteria\n2. Mechanism of action: Inhibition of arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis by inhibiting arabinosyl transferases encoded by the embCAB locus  \n3.

        "notes":["Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxigenase\n\nRuBisCOs and RuBisCo-like proteins are classified into four forms: \n(i) dominant form I, which consists of eight large and eight small subunits and is found in eukaryote and autotrophic proteobacteria;\n(ii) form II, with the simplest structure, consisting of the large subunits only, found in some bacteria and eukaryotic dinoflagellates;\n(iii) form III, consisting of the large subunits only, found in some Archaea;\n(iv) form IV (RuBisCo-like proteins, RLPs), lacking most of the conserved active site residues present in bona fide RuBisCo sequences, detected in Bacillus subtilis, Chlorobium tepidum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus.\n\nWhile forms I through III are capable of catalyzing both the carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, form IV is not .  RLP (form IV) from B. subtillis has been shown to catalyze the 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase reaction in the methionine salvage pathway (ref 3, see SS: Methionine_Salvage).  This role has been included in this SS merely to help disambiguate the two types of paralogs. \n\nIn a number of bacteria much of RuBisCo is packaged into polyhedral organelles, the carboxysomes.  For details see the Subsystem �Carboxysome�.\n\nFructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase / sedoheptulose-1,7- bisphosphate aldolase\n\nThere are two classes of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases (FBAs) with different catalytic mechanisms and no detectable sequence similarity, believed to have arisen independently during evolution.  Both classes of FBAs catalyze the cleavage of fructose-1,6-PP to glyceraldehyde-3-P and dihydroxyacetone-P in glycolysis or reverse aldol condensation in Calvin cycle.  In adition to aldol condensation of triose sugars, both classes of FBAs in photosynthetic eukaryotes and cyanobacteria (refs 4, 5, 6) and likely in other organisms (at least - with functional Calvin cycle) can condense DHAP and erythrose-4-phosphate to form sedoheptulose-1,7-PP.  \n\nFructose-1,6-bisphosphatase / sedoheptulose-1,7-P-bisphosphatase\n\nThe FBPase (EC 3.1.3.11) and SBPase (EC 3.1.3.37) steps of the Calvin cycle in eubacteria are catalyzed by a single enzyme with dual substrate specificity for both sugar bis-phosphates (7 and refs therein).  Since fructose-specific and dual-sugar-specific FBPases cannot be disambiguated based on protein sequence alone, an FBPase was annotated as an FBP/SBPase only in the organisms where dual specificity has been demonstrated experimentally (and in the close kin of those).  Higher-plant chloroplast FBP and SBP are encoded by distinct, but related, nuclear genes that have high specificity for their respective substrates.  \n\n\nPhosphoribulokinase\n\nPhosphoribulokinase activity, unique for Calvin cycle, has not been detected in any non-photosynthetic organisms. However, several Enterobacteriaceae (including E. coli) contain a close homolog of this gene in their genomes.  This putative enzyme of unknown function has been annotated here as �Phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19) homolog, function unknown� and is included in this Subsystem as an auxiliary role, even though it is not associated with Calvin cycle.\n\nGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n\nIn organisms with functional Calvin cycle of CO2 fixation often two distinct GAPDHs with different cofactor requirements (NAD vs NADP) catalyze glyceraldehyde-3P <-> 1,3-bisP-glycerate conversion in opposite directions (similar situation has been recently demonstrated in some nonphotosynthetic bacterial species as well (ref.12)). GAPDH isozymes acting in the direction of glycolysis have been annotated here as NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12).  Predominantly anabolic GAPDH isozymes are annotated as: NADPH-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.13).  They generally accept both NAD and NADP with the latter being preferred cofactor (ref 11,12).  \n    In this  Subsystem the presence of two distinct GAPDHs was projected from experimentally established cases [cyanobacteria (ref.11), Bacillus (ref.12)] to several other microbial groups, based on specific aa residues within the NAD(P)-binding domain, clustering on the chromosome, etc.\n    If a single copy of GAPDH gene was present in a genome with functional Calvin cycle, it was assumed that this enzymes drives glyceraldehyde-3P <-> 1,3-bisP-glycerate conversion in both directions.  Such PEGs were annotated as bifunctional:  EC 1.2.1.13 / EC 1.2.1.12.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe presence of clear, functionally active (ref 9) RuBisCo homologs in Archaeal genomes has long been a mystery due to he absence in all these genomes of the second key enzyme of the Calvin cycle, phosphoribulokinase.  Recently a novel pathway generating RuBP from 5-Phospho-a-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) without PRK has been proposed (ref 10).  PRPP is dephosphorylated (enzymaticaly or nonenzymaticaly) to D-Ribose 1,5-bisphosphate or D-Ribose-1,2-cyclic phosphate (extremely thermostable), which are converted to RuBP by ribose 1,5-bisphosphate or 5-ribose-1,2-cyclic phosphate dehydrogenase (see Diagram Tab)\n\nStrangely, genome sequence of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (former Alcaligenes eutrophus) as it appears in the JGI Microbial Genomes DB, does NOT contain either of the two cbb operons this organism is famous for�  A different species has been sequenced under this name??\n\nGenomes of Granulibacter bethesdensis and Methylobacterium extorquens each contain a clear ortholog of phosphoribulokinase (within a CO2-fixation-related gene cluster) but no RuBisCo.  Their genome sequences appear complete. Both are methylotrophs.  Significance is not clear\n\nReferences:\n\n1. In �The Physiology and Biochemistry of Prokaryotes� 2000. D.

        "notes":[" Thiamin monophosphate is formed by coupling of two independently synthesized moieties, hydroxymethylthiamin-PP (HMP-PP) and hydroxyethylthiazole-P (HET-P). The thiazole moiety is biosynthesized in Bacillus subtilis and most other bacteria from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), glycine, and cysteine in a complex oxidative condensation reaction [1]. This reaction requires five different proteins, ThiO, ThiG, ThiS, ThiF, and a cysteine desulfurase. Glycine oxidase (ThiO) catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to the corresponding glycine imine. Sulfur carrier protein adenylyl transferase (ThiF) catalyzes the adenylation of the carboxy-terminus of the sulfur carrier protein (ThiS-carboxylate), and cysteine desulfurase catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to the ThiS-acyl adenylate to give ThiS-thiocarboxylate. ThiG is the thiazole synthase and catalyzes the formation of the thiazole from dehydroglycine, DXP and ThiS-thiocarboxylate [2, 3, 4]. The thiazole moiety of thiamin in E. coli is derived from tyrosine, cysteine and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose phosphate [5]. The conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) into 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) is a fascinating reaction on the thiamin biosynthetic pathway in bacteria and is probably the most complex unresolved rearrangement in primary metabolism. The thiC gene complements all HMP requiring mutants in E.coli, S.typhimurium ,and B.subtilis [6].\r\n\r\n#1\tThiC: The pyrimidine moiety of thiamin, HMP-PP, is synthesized from 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR), an intermediate of the purine biosynthesis pathway. \r\n\r\n#2,3,4,5,6\tThiG, ThiS, ThiF, ThiH (or ThiO): The thiazole moiety of thiamin in E. coli is derived from tyrosine, cysteine and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose phosphate. Instead of tyrosine, B. subtilis uses glycine as a substrate for the synthesis of thiazole. In E. coli, two of the proteins required for the biosynthesis of thiazole are ThiG and ThiH. Thiazole synthase ThiG catalyzes the formation of the thiazole phosphate ring. Function of ThiH is not yet known. B. subtilis has another ThiG-associated enzyme, the FAD-dependent glycine oxidase ThiO, which catalyzes the oxidation of glycine to the corresponding imine. The closest structural relatives of ThiO are sarcosine oxidase and d-amino acid oxidase. The ThiO structure in B. subtilis has been resolved. ThiF catalyzes adenylation of the sulfur carrier protein ThiS by ATP. Because of the similarities between the ThiF/ThiS and MoeB/MoaD proteins involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin and molybdopterin cofactor, respectively, the sulfur transfer chemistry of these two biosynthetic pathways can be shared in some bacteria with only one ThiF/MoeB homolog. \r\n\r\n#7\tTHI4: The THI4 protein family has been shown to be involved in the thiazole synthesis in some eukaryotes [7] (Thi4 from S. cerevisiae, Thi2 from S. pombe, Thi1 from Zea mays, and STI35 from Fusarium sp). Among prokaryotes, Thi4 homologs are present in T. maritima and Archaea, replacing the bacterial-type thiazole synthesis pathway (#2,3,4,5,6).\r\n\r\n#8 \tThiD: HMP-P is phosphorylated by the bifunctional HMP kinase/HMP-P kinase ThiD. \r\n\r\n#9 \tThiN: ThiD from T. maritima and most archaea have an additional C-terminal domain of approximately 130 aa, named ThiN, whereas this domain is encoded by a separate gene in some Archaea. ThiN, is not similar to any known protein and contains no conserved motifs. In all cases when ThiE is absent and ThiD is present, there is the ThiN domain, although in many cases ThiN and ThiE co-exist. We suggest that this conserved domain is somehow involved in the TBS, possibly replacing the ThiE function in the genomes of some archaea and T. maritima.\r\n\r\n#10\tThiM: The HET kinase ThiM is involved in the salvage of thiazole from the culture medium.\r\n\r\n#11\tThiE: The ThiE protein catalyzes the formation of thiamin monophosphate via coupling of hydroxymethylthiamin-PP and hydroxyethylthiazole-P moieties.\r\n\r\n#12\tTenA: Conserved thiamin-related protein TenA is often associated with ThiD [8] (in some eukaryotes and bacteria tenA is fused to thiD). In systematic the discovery of analogous enzymes cariied out by Morett et al., 2003 [9], TenA have been shown to complement the thiC mutant in E. coli.,   however in most genomes the tenA and thiE genes co-exist. Recent biochemical characterization of TenA found the thiaminase II activity for this protein [10].\r\n\r\n#13 ThiL: Thiamin monophosphate is phosphorylated by ThiL to form thiamin pyrophosphate. \r\n\r\n#14, 15, 16\tThiXYZ: The hypothetical thiamin-related ABC transporter thiXYZ have upstream THI elements in all cases with only one exception in T. maritime [11]. In addition the  thiXYZ operons are often clustered with thiD. ThiXYZ was not found in the genomes without thiamin biosynthesis, but sometimes it occurs in genomes with the incomplete pathway without the ThiC enzyme. The need of HMP moiety for the thiamin biosynthesis is obvious. However, pathways other than thiamin, that could supply these compounds, are not known. The putative substrate-binding protein ThiY is similar to enzymes for the HMP biosynthesis from yeasts (Thi3 of S. pombe and Thi5 of S.cerevisiae). All found ThiY orthologs are predicted to have an N-terminal transmebrane segment, which is common for substrate-binding components of ABC transporters. Thus, we predict that ThiXYZ is a HMP transport system which substitutes for missing HMP biosynthesis in some bacteria. \r\n\r\n#17\tYuaJ:\tThe single THI-regulated gene yuaJ (the B. subtilis name) was found in most genomes of the Bacillus/Clostridium group [11]. It is always preceded by a THI element and is never clustered with TBS genes (only C. perfringes has two yuaJ paralogs, with and without an upstream THI element). YuaJ has six predicted transmembrane segments and is not similar to any known protein. yuaJ is the only thiamin-regulated gene in the complete genomes of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus pyogenes, which have no genes for the thiamin pathway. These observations strongly suggest that YuaJ is a thiamin transporter, which, in contrast to ThiBPQ, is obviously not ATP-dependent. In support of this prediction, the thiamin uptake in Bacillus cereus, which has yuaJ, is coupled to the proton movement  [12].\r\n\r\n#18,19,20\tThiBPQ: Well-characterized in enterobacteria ABC-type thiamin uptake transporter.\r\n\r\n#21\tCytX:  CytX encodes a hypothetical transporter with 12 predicted TMSs, which is similar to the cytosine permease CodB from E. coli [11]. Orthologs of this gene found in some diverse bacterial and archaeal species.  In all cases, cytX either clusters with the thiamin genes, or has upstream THI elements, or both. Based on positional analysis and similarity to pyrimidine transporter, the new thiamin-related transporter CytX is most likely involved in the HMP transport.\r\n\r\n#22\tThiW: The thiamin operons of some bacteria from the Bacillus/Clostridium group encode yet another thiamin-related transporter with 5 predicted transmembrane segments [11].  This gene, named thiW, is not similar to any known protein and has no homologs in other genomes. It is always THI-regulated and located immediately upstream of the thiM gene in all cases. As ThiW seems to complement the absence of HET pathway in T. tengcongensis and S. pneumoniae we tentatively predict that ThiW is involved in transport of the thiazole moiety of thiamin in the above bacteria.\r\n\r\n#23\tThiU: This gene from the Pasteurellaecae taxon is similar to transporters from the MFS family. In all cases thiU is clustered with the thiMDE genes and THI-regulated [11]. H. influenzae and P. multocida lack both HMP and HET pathways. The former is accounted for by the ThiXYZ system (see above). This, together with positional analysis, suggests that ThiU is a thiazole transporter.\r\n\r\n#24\tThiT:  The archaeal THI elements were found upstream of two paralogous genes, named thiT1 and thiT2, in each of the three Thermoplasma genomes [11]. These genes encode hypothetical transmembrane proteins with 9 predicted TMSs similar to transporters of the MFS family. Specificity of these transporters is not clear because of incompleteness of the thiamin pathways in thermoplasmas. However, based on the assumption that these transporters are the only thiamin-regulated genes in thermoplasmas, we propose their possible involvement in the thiamin transport.\r\n\r\n#25,26,27,28\tYkoEDCF: In some Gram-positive bacteria, we have found another thiamin-related ABC transporter, YkoE-YkoD-YkoC. It consists of two transmembrane components (YkoE and YkoC) and ATPase component (YkoD). We could not identify a substrate-binding component for this system. Similarly to thiXYZ, the ykoEDC genes always co-occur with the thiamin genes and are preceded by a THI element. They have been also found in genomes with the incomplete thiamin pathway. In B. subtilis, the first gene of the THI�regulated ykoFEDC operon is not similar to any known protein and has only one ortholog in Mesorhizobium loti, where it clusters with the above described candidate HMP-transporter, forming a THI-regulated cluster ykoFXYZ. Thus, the new ABC transport system YkoEDC is obviously thiamin-related, and most likely is involved in the HMP transport for thiamin. This prediction is based on positional clustering and on the following fact: when YkoEDC occurs in genomes lacking both HMP and HET pathways, there always is a candidate HET transporter, but not other HMP transporters [11].\r\n\r\n#29,30,31\tPnuT, Omr1, TPPK (tnr3): In two bacteria from the CFB group, B. fragilis and P. gingivalis, THI elements precede a hypothetical operon, named omr1-pnuT-tnr3. The omr1 gene is similar to TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors of Gram-negative bacteria that perform high-affinity binding and energy-dependent uptake of specific substrates into the periplasmic space. In another bacterium from the CFB group, Polaribacter filamentus, omr1 is a single gene which is preceded by a THI element. The pnuT gene encodes a hypothetical transporter which is similar to PnuC, N-ribosylnicotinamide transporters from enterobacteria. The PnuT proteins form a single branch on the phylogenetic tree of the PnuC family of transporters. The last gene of the omr1-pnuT-tnr3 operon is weakly similar to the C-terminal part of the thiamin pyrophosphokinase TNR3 from yeast S. pombe. Based on these data, we propose that the hypothetical THI-regulated omr1-pnuT-tnr3 operon could be involved in the thiamin salvage from the culture medium (transport and its subsequent phosphorylation up to thiamin pyrophosphate) [11].  In confirmation, the pnuT-tnr3 operon of H. pylori forms a divergon with the thiamin-related gene tenA.\r\n\r\n#32\tYlmB: Another new gene of the thiamin regulon belongs to the argE/dapE/ACY1/CPG2/yscS family of metallopeptidases. The single ylmB gene in B. subtilis and the putative ylmB-tenA-thiXYZ operon in B. halodurans are preceded  by THI elements, but no regulatory element was found upstream of the single ylmB gene in B. cereus. \r\n\r\n#33\tTK: The thiamin kinase activity is present in E. coli but corresponding gene is not yet characterized [13].\r\n\r\n#34\tTPP: The thiamin-phosphate phosphatase activity is present in yeast but corresponding gene is not yet characterized. Bacteria synthesize TPP via single phosphorylation of TP. Whereas eukaryote use distinct pathway to form an active coenzyme TPP: hydrolysis of TP to free thiamin is followed by pyrophosphorylation [14].\r\n\r\n#35\tTHI5: In yeast  and plants, the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin is synthesized using a distinct gene (nmt1 in Neurospora crassa, or THI5 in yeasts), and the initial substrates appear to be a histidine and pyridoxol-P [14, 15].\r\n\r\n#36\tTHI10: Thiamin transporter in yeast.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.\tBegley TP, Downs DM, Ealick SE, McLafferty FW, Van Loon AP, Taylor S, Campobasso N, Chiu HJ, Kinsland C, Reddick JJ, Xi J.

It�s widely spread homologs in other Gram(+)s species have been assigned with this function in SEED.   \n\nVariant code 1.8 � missing gene: 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGL) is missing, while Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (GPDH) is present\n\nVariant code 1*: � more missing genes in almost complete PPP (see Note below)\n\nVariant code 2 � minimal PPP, non-oxidative branch only, or even less � especially in minimal genomes of obligate parasites.\n\nVariant code 2.3 � codes 2 and 3 combined \n\nVariant code 2.9:  gene out of context: 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGL) appears to be present, while Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (GPDH), and  Phosphogluconate dehydratase (PglD) are missing.  Overannotation??\n\nVariant code 3 � PPP pathway in facultative heterofermentative Lactobacilli requires induction of phosphoketolase (D-Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase EC 4.1.2.9), an enzyme absent in the obligate homofermenters but present in facultative heterofermentative species.  In some species this enzyme seems to complement the absence of transketolase and transaldolase.  This enzyme has been also implicated in a variant of pentose phosphate metabolism in bifidobacteria, where PPP occurs through a characteristic sequence called the \"fructose-6-phosphate shunt\" or \"bifidus shunt\" (Scardovi and Trovatelli, 1965; De Vries et al, 1967; Fig. 3). The key enzymatic function of this pathway is fructose-6-phosphate-phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22), which cleaves hexose phosphate to erythrose-4-phosphate and acetyl-phosphate.  However, since no distinction between Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase and Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase activities can be made  currently based on protein sequence alone, and a single enzyme has been shown to catalyze both reactions in several species, all clear XPK/FPK homologs have been annotated as potentially capable of catalyzing both reactions - �Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9); Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22)� probably leading to severe over-annotation.  In an attempt to minimize the damage, the XPK/FPK homologs where FPK activity was experimentally demonstrated (in Bifidum species) or could be inferred from genome context (see below) were annotated �Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9) / Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22)�  with a slash �/�. In addition to Bifidobacteria these include Clostridium acetobutylicum and Streptococcus agalactiae where the absence of Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating (EC 1.1.1.44) may necessitate FPK activity in XPK/FPK homolog.\n\nVariant code 4:  the first two enzymes of oxidative PPP branch are absent, but 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44) can be clearly detected.  In this case hexoses can be fed into PPP through D-gluconate (via gluconate kinase EC:2.7.1.12)\n\nVariant code 5: first 2 enzymes of the oxidative PPP are present, but 6-P-gluconate produced is further dehydrated to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-P-gluconate via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (see subsystem �Entner-Doudoroff pathway�), rather then being oxidized to ribulose-5-phosphate (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase EC 1.1.1.44 is absent)\n\nExcellent comparative genome analysis of the biosynthesis of ribose-5-phosphate and erythrose-4-phosphate in archaea has been recently published by T. Soderberg (2005). It has clarified greatly configuration of PPP in archaea:\n\nVariant code 6:  in addition to classic PPP non-oxidative branch, two enzymes of the RuMP pathway (HPS+PHI) may contribute to ribose biosynthesis acting in reverse. \n\nVariant code 7:  (i) instead of PPP ribose-5-P biosynthesis is apparently carried out by reversed RuMP; (ii) but the E4P biosynthesis is required for production of aromatic amino acids, hence transketolase is retained in these species.\n\nVariant code 8: (i) the ribose-5-P biosynthesis is apparently carried out by reversed RuMP pathway in place of PPP; (ii) transketolase is absent as well � notably, these species utilize an alternate early phase of the chorismate pathway that does not involve E4P as a precursor (Tumbula et al. 1997; White 2004). \n\nVariant code 9: a single enzyme of OPPP (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) is present, the pentose synthesis in may occur via a modified OPPP, although the details of this putative pathway are yet unclear\n\n*:  In all variants a star (*) AFTER the code indicates missing gene(s) in an otherwise complete set of genes required for a specific variant. This can be due to sequencing and/or ORF calling mistakes, as well as to genuine absence of gene(s) from a genome.  A star BEFORE the code labels genomes that were not manually curated yet\n"]},

A system designed for this purpose was developed in Escherichia coli strains, allowing 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate accumulation to be experimentally induced and measured by extraction of the cell pool. Addition of gluconate to a strain which lacked 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase and overproduced 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase resulted in an increase in the intracellular concentration of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate from undetectable levels to 2.0 mM within 15 s, as measured by anion-exchange HPLC. The accumulation of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate was correlated with an immediate and significant decrease in growth; this inhibition was determined to be bacteriostatic and not bactericidal. It had been proposed that the mechanism of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate toxicity involves competitive inhibition of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and the consequent block of the pentose phosphate pathway. An experiment addressing this hypothesis failed to provide any supporting data.\r\n"],

        "description":"The ketogenic properties of a variety of microorganisms have been known for many years and are of industrial importance.  For example, 2-keto-L-gulonate is a key intermediate in the industrial biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by the glucose pathway (Sonoyama  et al., 1982, Grindley et al., 1998); and 5-keto-D-gluconate (5-KDG) can be converted to industrially important L-(+)-tartaric acid (Merfort et al., 2006).  On the other hand, production of 2,5-DKG by P. citrea appears to be responsible for the dark color characteristic of the pink disease of pineapple (Pujol and Kado, 2000).  \r\n\r\nOxidation of D-glucose to the ketogluconates [2-keto-D-gluconate (2-KDG), 5-keto-D-gluconate (5-KDG), and 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate (2,5-DKG)] is mediated by specialized membrane-bound dehydrogenases (consisting of 3 subunits) linked to the cytochrome chain (Pujol, Kado, 2000; Tsuya et al., 2006; Matsushita et al., 2003).  An effort has been made in this SS to disambiguate these closely related enzymes via projecting substrate specificity from a few experimentally characterized ones to their orthologs in other organisms using phylogenetic trees.  However, the results presented here should be taken very cautiously, since omissions and errors are unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent metabolism of the ketogluconates (some of which can serve as the sole source of carbon and energy for various bacteria) proceeds via convertion to 6-phosphogluconate, which is further metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff  (EDP) and/or Pentose Phosphate pathways (PPP). \r\n\r\nTwo different metabolic routes from the ketogluconates to 6-PGA have been described.  The first, nonphosphorylative pathway, observed for example in Erwinia herbicola, begins with reduction of the ketogluconate by NAD(P)H to gluconate by soluble NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes capable of reducing either 2-KDG, 5-KDG, or 2,5-DKG.  This step is followed by phosphorylation to 6-PGA.   The second route, present in genera Pseudomonas and Burkholderia (Var.code 4), begins with the phosphorylation of 2-KDG at the 6 position followed by reduction to 6-PGA (this pathway is not included in this Subsystem (SS), see SS: �2-Ketogluconate Utilization� for details.\r\n\r\nThe first, nonphosphorylative pathway, can proceed either through 2-keto-L-gulonate//L-idonate route, described for example in Erwinia (Truesdell et al., 1991) and E. coli (Bausch et al., 1998); or via broad specificity 2-ketoaldonate reductase, which is able to reduce  2,5-diketo-D-gluconate, 2-keto-D-gluconate and 2-keto-L-gulonate (Yum et al., 1998  , Yum et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n1 = Minimal functional SS variant: organism is capable of uptake (and in some cases of production) of D-gluconate (but not ketogluconates), possessing: (1) Glucose DH (PQQ-dependent), (2) one or more gluconate transporter(s), and (3) gluconokinase (GlcK) or Gluconate dehydratase (GLD), channeling external or internally produced D-gluconate to EDP or PPP pathways.  Note, that this variant code is still assigned if either (1) OR (2) is missing (due to the fact that prediction of substrate specificities of these enzymes from genome sequence alone are notoriously unreliable).  Hence, false-positive assignments of var.code 1 are more likely than omissions.\r\n    1.1 = PPP is utilized for D-gluconate utilization  (PglDH is present) via GlcK\r\n    1.2 = EDP is utilized for D-gluconate utilization (KDPGA is present) via GlcK\r\n    1.3 = both, EDP and PPP are utilized for D-gluconate utilization\r\n    1.4 = GlcK is absent, but D-gluconate is utilized via Gluconate dehydratase (GLD) in place of phosphorylation\r\n    1.4* = GlcK is absent, but gluconate is likely utilized via Gluconate dehydratase (GLD) in place of phosphorylation, however, a gene for GLD has not been identified in this organisms yet, e.g. Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Szymona, Doudoroff, 1958) or E. coli (Zablotny et al., 1967).  Such cases when GLD activity has been demonstrated in an organism (or inferred), but a gene is not known, are common apparently.  \r\n\r\n 3 = in addition to D-gluconate, organism is capable of 2-KDG, and/or 5-KDG, and/or 2,5-DKG production due to predicted presence of specialized membrane-bound dehydrogenases (2KGK is absent).  Numbers after the dot have the same meaning as above.\r\n\r\n 4 = organism is capable of 2-KDG, and/or 5-KDG, and/or 2,5-DKG production due to predicted presence of specialized membrane-bound dehydrogenases; and 2-KDG can be utilized via phosphorylative pathway (2KGK is present)\r\n\r\n 5 = L-idonate, 5-keto-D-gluconate uptake and catabolism can be asserted\r\n\r\n 6 = rich variety of several ketogluconate reductases are present, but not L-idonate reductase + 5-keto-D-gluconate pathway\r\n\r\n 8 = glucose oxidation via 2-KDG, and/or 5-KDG, and/or 2,5-DKG membrane-bound dehydrogenases can be asserted, but ketogluconates produced are apparently excreted since enzymes required for their downstream metabolism via EDP or PPP are missing??\r\n\r\n9 = No known glucose DH [NAD(P)H, or PQQ, or 3-subunit FAD-dependent] or gluconate transporter of any kind can be asserted. However, GlcK or GLD are present. The source of  D-gluconate (which is apparently being channeling by these enzymes to EDP or PPP pathways) is not clear at the moment.  Unidentified D-gluconate transporter  or a novel internal source of D-gluconate is present??  Over-annotation of GlcK??  Numbers after the dot have the same meaning as above \r\n\r\n-1 = none of ketogluconate dehydrogenases or reductases can be asserted, and both, gluconokinase (GlcK) and gluconate dehydratase (GLD) are absent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nBausch C, Peekhaus N, Utz C, Blais T, Murray E, Lowary T, Conway T.

        "description":"Pathogenic mycobacteria require type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport virulence factors across\r\ntheir complex cell envelope. These bacteria have up to five of these systems, termed ESX-1 to ESX-5. This Subsystem encodes locus ESX-2 in all Mycobacterial genomes currently available in the SEED database.\r\n\r\nESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen, is the prototype of a novel family of small proteins (ESX) of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms.  The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has 23 ESX proteins, encoded by genes esxA through esxW, arranged in tandem pairs in 11 genomic loci, known as the ESX or ESAT-6 loci \r\n\r\nExport of ESAT-6 and related proteins requires a dedicated secretory apparatus, variously named ESAT-6- , SNM-, ESX-, or type VII secretion system (Bitter et al., 2009). Components of these secretion machinery are commonly encoded by clusters of genes co-localized with the ESAT-6 (ESX) family proteins. Out of the 11 ESX loci in the genome of M. tuberculosis, five (ESX-1 through ESX-5) include secretion system components.  Among them region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) is believed to be ancestral.  Only the ESX-1 region (corresponding to RD1) is encoded in this SS, please see the following subsystems for loci ESX-2 through ESX-5:\r\n\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-2)\r\n    ...........\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-5)\r\n\r\nConservative gene clusters containing proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative secretion system (SNM) have been identified in other Gram-positive pathogens as well, including Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diptheriae and Listeria monocytogenes (Pallen, 2002).  In Staphylococcus aureus SNM  homologues are required for secretion of ESAT-6-like proteins (Burts et al ., 2005).  As with mycobacteria, loss of ESAT-6 secretion in S. aureus  correlates with reduced virulence.  While the role of these homologues in other Gram(+) species is not yet determined, mounting evidence suggests that this alternative secretion system will be important for virulence in many acid-fast and Gram-positive pathogens. \r\n\r\nGiven its role in pathogenesis, it is curious that the ESAT-6/Esx/SNM secretion system also functions in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. M. smegmatis  has a genetic locus homologous to RD1 and is able to secrete ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homologues (Gey Van Pittius et al .,2001; Converse and Cox, 2005). Interestingly, mutations in M. smegmatis SNM homologues not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (Converse and Cox, 2005), but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (Flint et al ., 2004).  While the SNM pathway may have different functions in various bacteria, similarity of snm  genes suggests that the core mechanism of SNM secretion is conserved. \r\n\r\n",

Bacterial Csps are mainly induced after a rapid temperature downshift to regulate the adaptation to cold stress, but are also present under normal conditions to regulate other biological functions. The structural unit characteristic for Csps occurs also as a cold shock domain (CSD) in other proteins and can be found in wide variety of organisms from bacteria to vertebrates. Important examples are the Y-box proteins that are known to be involved in regulation of several transcription and translation processes\"  (quoted from PMID:17437059)\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nHorn G1, Hofweber R, Kremer W, Kalbitzer HR. 2007 Structure and function of bacterial cold shock proteins.

        "description":"Subsystem under construction\r\n\r\nPseudomonas aeruginosa produces extracellular glycolipids composed of L-rhamnose and 3-hydroxyalkanoic acid called rhamnolipids.  These compounds are considered important virulence factors and are found in high concentrations in sputa of  P. aeruginosa-colonized cystic fibrosis patients (Kownatzki  et al., 1987).  They interfere with the normal  tracheal ciliary function (Read et al., 1992), inhibit the  phagocytic response of macrophages (McClure & Schiller,  1996) and act as heat-stable extracellular haemolysins  (Johnson & Boese-Marrazzo, 1980). In liquid cultures, they are produced as a complex mixture of congeners containing one or two 3-hydroxy fatty acids of various length, linked to a mono- or di-rhamnose moiety (Deziel et al., 1999, 2000).  In general, the two more abundant rhamnolipids are L-rhamnosyl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-3-hydroxydecanoate and L-rhamnosyl-L-rhamnosyl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-3-hydroxydecanoate (Lang & Wullbrandt, 1999; Maier & Soberon-Chavez, 2000).\r\n\r\nRhamnolipids have been usually regarded as biosurfactants or haemolysins, and their real physiological function has been elucidated only recently. Di-rhamnolipid (L-rhamnosyl-L-rhamnosyl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-3-hydroxydecanoate) and novel biosurfactant 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acids (HAAs), have been recently shown to serve as self-generated surface-specific stimuli (Tremblay et al., 2007) promoting recently discovered swarming motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Kohler et al., 2000).  Mono-rhamnolipid (L-rhamnosyl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-3-hydroxydecanoate) was shown in the same elegant study (Tremblay et al., 2007) to be a wetting agent, produced to reduce the surface tension between the migrating cells and the surface beneath them.\r\n",

In Gram-positive bacteria, GalN and glucosamine (GlcN) have been reported in the glycosylation motif of a glycoprotein toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis and proposed to be important to the biological activities of the toxin (PMID:3804977).  GalN was also identified as a possible component of a galactose-containing polysaccharide from Streptococcus mutans (PMID:3196739)\r\n \r\nThe synthesis and transfer of this amino sugar in Mycobacterium spp. depends on a polyprenyl-phosphate-linked sugar donor (rather than nucleotide-sugar donor), namely polyprenyl-linked galactosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine.  PpgS, a sugar nucleotide-utilizing glycosyltransferase, catalyzes the formation of polyprenyl (C35/C50)-P-d-GalNAc from UDP-&#945;-d-GalNAc and polyprenyl-P on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. This sugar donor is then presumably deacylated by an as yet unknown deacetylase before or after the membrane-associated glycosyltransferase Rv3779 transfers the d-GalNp (or d-GalNAc) residue from polyprenyl-P-d-GalN(Ac) to the C2 position of a portion of the internal 3,5-branched d-Araf residues of AG  (Skovierova et al., 2010). \r\n \r\nReferences\r\nSkovierov� H1, Larrouy-Maumus G, Pham H et al., and Jackson M.  2010.

        "description":"Pathogenic mycobacteria require type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport virulence factors across their complex cell envelope. These bacteria have up to five of these systems, termed ESX-1 to ESX-5. This Subsystem encodes locus ESX-3 in all Mycobacterial genomes currently available in the SEED database.\r\n\r\nESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen, is the prototype of a novel family of small proteins (ESX) of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms.  The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has 23 ESX proteins, encoded by genes esxA through esxW, arranged in tandem pairs in 11 genomic loci, known as the ESX or ESAT-6 loci \r\n\r\nExport of ESAT-6 and related proteins requires a dedicated secretory apparatus, variously named ESAT-6- , SNM-, ESX-, or type VII secretion system (Bitter et al., 2009). Components of these secretion machinery are commonly encoded by clusters of genes co-localized with the ESAT-6 (ESX) family proteins. Out of the 11 ESX loci in the genome of M. tuberculosis, five (ESX-1 through ESX-5) include secretion system components.  Among them region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) is believed to be ancestral.  Only the ESX-1 region (corresponding to RD1) is encoded in this SS, please see the following subsystems for loci ESX-2 through ESX-5:\r\n\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-2)\r\n    ...........\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-5)\r\n\r\nConservative gene clusters containing proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative secretion system (SNM) have been identified in other Gram-positive pathogens as well, including Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diptheriae and Listeria monocytogenes (Pallen, 2002).  In Staphylococcus aureus SNM  homologues are required for secretion of ESAT-6-like proteins (Burts et al ., 2005).  As with mycobacteria, loss of ESAT-6 secretion in S. aureus  correlates with reduced virulence.  While the role of these homologues in other Gram(+) species is not yet determined, mounting evidence suggests that this alternative secretion system will be important for virulence in many acid-fast and Gram-positive pathogens. \r\n\r\nGiven its role in pathogenesis, it is curious that the ESAT-6/Esx/SNM secretion system also functions in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. M. smegmatis  has a genetic locus homologous to RD1 and is able to secrete ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homologues (Gey Van Pittius et al .,2001; Converse and Cox, 2005). Interestingly, mutations in M. smegmatis SNM homologues not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (Converse and Cox, 2005), but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (Flint et al ., 2004).  While the SNM pathway may have different functions in various bacteria, similarity of snm  genes suggests that the core mechanism of SNM secretion is conserved. \r\n\r\n",

Here, we show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecX binds directly to M. tuberculosis RecA as well as M. smegmatis and E. coli RecA proteins in vivo and in vitro, but not single-stranded DNA binding protein. The direct association of RecX with RecA failed to regulate the specificity or extent of binding of RecA either to DNA or ATP, ligands that are central to activation of its functions. Significantly, RecX severely impeded ATP hydrolysis and the generation of heteroduplex DNA promoted by homologous, as well as heterologous, RecA proteins. These findings reveal a mode of negative regulation of RecA, and imply that RecX might act as an anti-recombinase to quell inappropriate recombinational repair during normal DNA metabolism.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 12218174 \r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n Proteins. 2009 Feb 1;74(2):530-7.\r\n    Crystal structure of RecX: a potent regulatory protein of RecA from Xanthomonas campestris.\r\n    Yang CY, Chin KH, Yang MT, Wang AH, Chou SH.\r\n\r\n \r\n    PMID: 19003992 \r\n"],

        "notes":["A remarkable feature of the genus Listeria is the presence of �internalin multigene family�.  Members of this family contain N-terminal LRR (leucine-rich repeat) domain, a conserved inter-repeat region, and often - various other repeats.  The LRR domain consists of 4 to 28 copies of tandem repeats of 22 amino acids with conserved leucine or isoleucine residues at positions 3, 6, 9, 11, 16, and 22.  The majority of Listeria internalins also contain C-terminal LPXTG sorting signal, which is utilized by sortase for covalent linkage of LPXTG-containing proteins to m-diaminopimelic acid of the cell wall.  A few internalins lacking this motif are believed to be secreted (like InlC), or anchored in cell wall via interaction of GW modules with lipoteichoic acids (like InlB).  \r\n\r\nSeveral internalins have been directly implicated in Listeria internalization and/or virulence.  For instance, InlA (its N-terminal half) is necessary and sufficient for internalization of Listeria (or even latex beads) by permissive host cells.  Internalins E, H, and G, while not essential for internalization, were shown to be relevant for virulence in murine model.\r\n\r\nFrom 13 to 26 internalins were identified in genomes of various Listeria strains/isolates, with a few being strain-specific.  Many are grouped, forming �internalin islets� in a genome.  Of special interest are proteins, orthologs of which are present in pathogenic L. monocytogenes strains and absent from non-pathogenic L. innocua.\r\n\r\nLRR domains are mostly present in eukaryotes with only a few occurring in prokaryotic proteins (usually virulence-associated) outside genus Listeria (columns 1 and 2 in the SS spreadsheet above). \r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n 1 = patern of Int-like proteins in variuous strains of pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes\r\n 2 = patern of Int-like proteins in non-pathogenic Listeria innocua\r\n 4 = other species harboring a few Int-like proteins\r\n 5 = other species with extensive internalin protein family\r\n-1 = an organism does not produce Int-like proteins\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.

        "notes":["DNA bases can be damaged oxidation, deamination, or akylation. The DNA repair process of BER consists of the following 5 steps.   \n1)The lesion in the DNA caused by the damaged base is detected by a glycosylase that pinches the DNA. A damaged base forms an unstable bond with the base on the other strand of DNA. When the glycosylase pinches the DNA, the damaged base becomes exposed due to the unstable bond, and the glycosylase cleaves off the base leaving the deoxyribose phosphate moiety attached to the rest of the strand. Different glycosylases exist to detect different types of damage. \n2)An endonuclease then breaks the single strand of DNA on the 5� side of the base-free deoxyribose moiety.\n3)The deoxy ribose moiety is then excised by an exonuclease.\n4)A DNA polymerase then fills in the gap with the correct base using the undamaged strand as a template.\n5)A DNA ligase rejoins the phosphodiester backbone of the repaired strand.  \n\nIn some organism these five steps are performed by five separate proteins. In other organisms, some proteins are capable of performing multiple roles. This subsystem represents an on-going exploration of the types of damage each organism can detect, which organisms possess multi-functional roles, as well as the possibility of alternate roles for different conditions and/or redundancy. It is very likely that many of these genomes possess proteins not contained in this subsystem that are capable of detecting other types of damage, or performing the next four steps of this subsystem. It should be also noted that in the literature the terms exonuclease and endonuclease are often used in place of one another. This curator believes exonuclease should only refer to activity that breaks the external or exposed bond between the 3'-carbon of the sugar and the 5'-phosphate, and endonuclease should only refer to activity that breaks the internal bond between the 5'-carbon of the sugar and 3'-phosphate on the other side of the apurinic/apyrimidinic site.\n\nVariant Codes:\n\nGenomes with a variant code of 1,2,3,4 all have the ability to detect at least one type of damage to a base.\n\nGenomes with a variant code of 1 indicate that each role is performed by a separate enzyme.\n\nGenomes with a variant code of 2 indicate having an endonuclease that is capable of also performing the role of the glycosylase and the exonuclease.\n\nGenomes with a variant code of 3 (archaeal)indicate this curator's speculation that perhaps the endonucleases in column 'end3' might also be capable of performing the role of an exonuclease and the polymerase based on the possible activities of the domains present as indicated by Psi-blast, 3'-5' phosphodiesterase and RNase H(reverse transcriptase) activity respectively. These proteins are also virtually the same length as eukaryotic polymerase B. \n\nGenomes with a variant code of 4 indicate this curator's speculation that perhaps the some of the polymerases in column \"pol1\" are capable of also performing as an exonuclease due to the catalytic domains present as indicated by Psi-blast. The proteins in column \"pol1\" of genomes with variant codes other than 4 should also be looked at for performing the exonuclease step as well.   \n\nFurther investigation of variant codes 3 and 4 are necessary.\n\nVariant code 9 is for Genomes where it is suspected that a functioning version of this subsystem exists but further investigation is required to identify the genes repsonsible for one or more roles.\n\nThe number of additional nucleotides, adjacent to the damaged nucleotide, that may also be removed as part of the repair process depends on which enzyme performs the role, and should also be the subject of further study according to the following paper:\n\n\"The post-incision steps of the DNA base excision repair pathway in Escherichia coli: studies with a closed circular DNA substrate containing a single U:G base pair\"\nMargarita Sandigursky, Greg A.

The precursor peptides of these natural products are ribosomally produced, upon which a combination of modification enzymes installs diverse functional groups. This genetically encoded peptide-based strategy allows for rapid diversification of these natural products by mutation in the precursor genes merged with unique combinations of modification enzymes. Thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins (TOMMs) are a class of RiPPs defined by the presence of heterocycles derived from cysteine, serine, and threonine residues in the precursor peptide. TOMMs encompass a number of different families, including but not limited to the linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (streptolysin S, microcin B17, and plantazolicin), cyanobactins, thiopeptides, and bottromycins. Although many TOMMs have been explored, the increased availability of genome sequences has illuminated several unexplored TOMM producers.\n\n\n",

For the final step of butyrate synthesis from butyryl-CoA, two alternative pathways are known: the enzymes phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase convert butyryl-CoA to butyrate with the intermediate formation of butyryl-phosphate. This pathway, which is found in C. acetobutylicum, is analogous to the formation of acetate from acetyl-CoA and leads to energy generation in the form of ATP. Alternatively, a butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase transfers the CoA moiety to external acetate, which leads to the formation of acetyl-CoA and butyrate. \n",

Alternative pathways of glucose catabolism (Pentose Phosphate and/or Entner-Doudoroff pathways) are used in place of glycolysis. Glyconeogenesis is either nonfunctional or is catalyzed by yet unknown nonorthologous variants of enzymes (e.g. no FBP can be detected in a genome, glyconeogenesis in such organisms doesn�t proceed beyond fructose 1,6-phosphate probably, but intermediates can be fed into PPP - for synthesis of essential compounds). Example - Tropheryma\r\n\r\n-1 = the majority of glycolytic and glyconeogenetic enzymes are not present in a genome, no functional EPM/glyconeogenesis can be asserted\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition multi-positional encoding of variant codes was attempted here in order to capture (at least a fraction of!) endless variations of EMP and glyconeogenesis in various microbial groups (they appear after the dot):  \r\n\r\nFIRST digit reflects the type of a sugar kinase catalyzing formation of glucose-6-P in an organism:\r\n\r\n1 = an ATP-dependent hexo- or glucokinase(s) is present \r\n2 = a polyphosphate-dependent glucokinase(s) is present .  ATP yield of glycolysis is theoretically higher in this case.\r\n8 = both types of kinases (ATP- and PPi-dependent) can be asserted in an organism\r\n9 = no sugar kinase could be identified.  An organism must relay on a PTS system or/and on phosphoglucomutase (pgm) to generate glucose-6-P.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND digit reflects a type of 6-phosphofructokinase (Pfk) present:\r\n\r\n1 = ATP-dependent Pfk is present (one or several types)\r\n2 = PPi-dependent Pfk is present. ATP yield of glycolysis is higher in this case. Since PPi-PFK is capable of catalyzing the reverse reaction (Deng et al, 1999), it can also act in gluconeogenesis. \r\n8 = both type of 6-phosphofructokinase (ATP- and PPi-dependent) can be asserted\r\n9 = no ortholog of known PFKs can be detected in a genome.  In the majority of these organisms the presence of glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (GPDH, included in this SS) catalyzing the first step of alternative pathways of glucose catabolism indicates that Entner-Doudoroff and/or Pentose Phosphate pathways are used in place of glycolysis.  This is apparently the case in: all sequenced species of Neisseria, Bordetella, Bifidobacterium, Pseudomonas, Helicobacter pylori, many others.  The absence of both enzymes - Pfk and GPDH in an organism generally indicates complete inability to utilize hexoses as sole sources of carbon and energy.  This is likely the case in: all Bordetella species, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter hepaticus, Acinetobacter sp., Psychrobacter sp., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD digit reflects the presence/ absence of some form of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP), required for functional pathway of glyconeogenesis:\r\n\r\n1 = a clear ortholog of at least one form of FBP is present \r\n8 = several FBPs of different types are present (redundancy)\r\n7 = no FBP can be detected in a genome, but PPi-dependent PFK is present. Since PPi-PFK is capable of catalyzing the reverse reaction (Deng et al, 1999), it can also act in gluconeogenesis.  This is the case in Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, and in all Chlamydophila, Borrelia, Treponema species sequenced to date.\r\n9 = no FBP can be detected in a genome. This implies either the presence of a novel non-orthologous  FBP variant in these organisms, or the existence of yet unknown compensating pathway, or strict dependency on exogenous carbohydrates for essential anabolic precursors. This is the case in Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Ureaplasma parvum, all sequenced species of Streptococcus and Xylella fastidiosa.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH digit reflects a type of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) present:\r\n\r\n1 = a single universal GAPDH apparently acts in both - glycolysis AND glyconeogenesis\r\n2 = two distinct GAPDHs with different cofactor requirements catalyze glyceraldehyde-3P <-> 1,3-bisP-glycerate conversion in opposite directions.  This is often the case in organisms with functional Calvin cycle of CO2 fixation, but recently has been also demonstrated in nonphotosynthetic bacterial species � Bacillus (Fillinger et al., 2000).  Thus, the third regulatory point has been identified in EMP/glyconeogenesis.  In this Subsystem the presence of two distinct GAPDHs was projected to several microbial groups (based on specific aa residues within the NAD(P)-binding domain, clustering on the chromosome, etc)\r\n3 = as #2, but non-phosphorylating G3PNP catalyses irreversible oxidation of G3P in the direction of glycolysis.  ATP yield of glycolysis is lower in this case\r\n4 = only non-phosphorylating G3PNP appears to be present in an organism. Very rare, example: Ureaplasma.\r\n9 = no GAPDH.  Extremely rare � occurs only in such obligate intracellular parasites as Rickettsia\r\n\r\n\r\nFor simplicity the following variations of EMP/glycolysis have NOT been reflected in variant codes:\r\n\r\n6. The presence/absence of Pyruvate kinase (PyK) acting in the direction of glycolysis.  Its absence in a complete (or nearly complete) genome indicates either a non-orthologous replacement with yet-to-be-discovered Pyk variant, or an existence of another route for PEP - pyruvate conversion, for instance, during sugar(s) uptake via PTS, PEP carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31), or reversion of PpD or PpS reaction direction.  No clear orthologs of PyK could be asserted in the genomes of: Aquifex aeolicus, Wolinella succinogenes DSM 1740, Helicobacter, Chlorobium tepidum TLS, Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405, Porphyromonas gingivalis W83, etc. \r\n\r\n7.  An organism�s deduced ability to convert pyruvate directly to PEP via Phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PpS) or Pyruvate,phosphate dikinase (PpD).  In the absence of at least one of these enzymes other routes of PEP synthesis must be utilized instead � for example, PEP carboxykinase or malic enzyme (see SS Pyruvate Metabolism).  No clear orthologs of PsS or PpD could be identified in the genomes of: Campylobacter jejuni, all sequenced species of Chlamydia, Buchnera, Haemophilus, Mycoplasma, etc.  Surprisingly, Pyruvate,phosphate dikinase is the only EMP enzyme preserved in genomes of all Rickettsia!  It�s purpose there is not clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.  The absence of any form of Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is extremely rare.  Among genomes finished to 1 contig only a few lack it: Streptococcus mitis, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA.  While S. mitis is lacking several other EPM enzymes as well (relying on the host instead?),  in Geobacter EMP appears operational.  A gene candidates for this missing function has been suggested in Geobacter genomes in this SS, but it is not very strong, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nA note of caution: in unfinished genomes any �9� in variant code should be taken with a grain of salt.  The gene may be as well present � but could have been missed or fragmented beyond recognition by an ORF-calling program.  A DNA BLAST against the genome of interest is recommended.  The state of complete for each genome can be assessed from the FIG Search page � look at the window �If You Need to Pick a Genome for Options Below�.

        "description":"The pseudodisaccharide mycothiol (1D-myo-inosityl 2-(N-acetylcysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-a-D-glucopyranoside) is the principal thiol found in mycobacteria and most other actinomycetes.  It appears to function in many ways like glutathione, which is not produced by actinomycetes.  As such, it acts as an electron acceptor/donor and serves as a cofactor in detoxification reactions for alkylating agents, free radicals and xenobiotics. In addition, like glutathione, mycothiol may be involved in catabolic processes with an essential role for growth on recalcitrant chemicals such as aromatic compounds. At least four enzymes (MshA, MshB, MshC, MshD) are currently known to be involved in mycothiol biosynthesis (see Tab \"Illustrations\").  Identified MSH-dependent enzymes include:\n- mycothione reductase (disulfide reductase Mtr)\n- S-nitrosomycothiol reductase / formaldehyde DH MscR\n- MSH S-conjugate amidase Mca\n- MSH-dependent maleylpyruvate isomerase.\n\nMycothiol metabolism might provide suitable targets for new drugs directed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Support for this possibility came from studies of Mycobacterium smegmatis chemical mutants blocked in MSH biosynthesis.  Mycothiol mutants were shown to have enhanced sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and various toxins, including rifampin and other antibiotics, but were found to be resistant to isoniazid.\n",

        "notes":["Most eukaryotes, cyanobacteria, and &#945;,&#946;,&#947;-proteobacteria synthesize glutathione.  Yet the evolutionary history of glutathione biosynthesis is convoluted, and other aerobic microorganisms use different thiol cofactors to resist oxidative damage (Fahey RC.  2001).  For example, low G+C Gram-positive bacteria produce excess amounts of CoASH for this purpose, whereas high G+C Gram-positive bacteria produce mycothiol (encoded in SS:\"Glutathione analogs: Mycothiol\") or ergothioneine.  Gamma-glutamyl-cysteine is produced by Halobacteria (Newton, Javor, 1985), and trypanothione � by trypanosomatids (see SS: \"Glutathionylspermidine and Trypanothione\").  Methanogenic archaea contain significant amounts of coenzyme M, a thiol cofactor that like glutathione has been recruited into pathways to degrade oxidized metabolites (Allen et al., 1999).\n\nThe presence in Actinobacteria of the hypothetical protein family currently annotated in SEED as \"Similar to Glutamate--cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.2), function unknown\" is puzzling, since glutathione is NOT produced in these organisms (e.g. fig|246196.1.peg.6211)\n\nReferences\n\nNewton GL, Fahey RC.  2002.

        "description":"The widely used biocide triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol, TCS] has a broad-spectrum capacity to kill many microorganisms and is a constituent in a variety of personal care products. An enormous amount of TCS has been released into the environment (PMID: 26006133), and TCS-resistant bacteria are abundant in nature. Several known mechanisms that confer resistance to this biocide include: (i) overexpression of ENR; (ii) presence of mutated and/or TCS-tolerant ENR; (iii) changes in the outer membrane; (iv) up regulation of efflux pumps and (v) the presence of other potential target genes (PMID:16922622; PMID: 27577999) \n\nTriclosan targets enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases (ENRs), which catalyze the last enoyl reduction step in bacterial fatty acid elongation cycle (PMID:10196195). Namely, the reduction of a trans-2-acyl-ACP (an enoyl-ACP) to the fully saturated acyl-ACP species. The reductant is either NADH or NADPH, although in one case a reduced flavin (FMNH2) is used as an intermediate in the reduction (PMID: 19151923)\n\nNotably, ENRs display an unusual diversity among organisms (unlike other enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis).  Selective emergence of different types of ENR could be due to the fact that a variety of both synthetic and natural antibacterial compounds are shown to specifically target their activity, e.g. triclosan and isoniazid (PMID: 27577999). So far, four ENR isozymes have been characterized in bacteria, namely FabI, FabL, FabV, and FabK (PMID:19151923). Most of them are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, except for FabK, which is completely TCS-refractory and is a non-SDR ENR (PMID:27577999)\n\nEnoyl-[ACP] reductases of the FabI/InhA type are highly susceptible to triclosan, while FabV and FabK are  essentially refractory to it (e.g. expression of S. pneumoniae FabK in E. coli raises the TCL concentration required to inhibit growth by over 4 orders of magnitude (PubMed: 12487627)). FabL is only poorly inhibited by TCL, and this inhibition is reversible (PMID: 21185310)\n\nA important feature of the well-studied inhibitors of SDR family ENRs (InhA and FabI) is that inhibition requires the NAD+ product to be bound within the active site. That is, the inhibitor forms a stable ternary complex with the protein and the oxidized cofactor. Some inhibitors form a covalent bond with NAD+ whereas others do not. The fact that each of these inhibitors must complete a catalytic cycle and bind the inhibitor before the weakly bound NAD+ product is released accounts for the observed slow inhibition of ENR activity. The extensive interactions made by the inhibitors with both the NAD+ moiety and the protein in the ternary complex readily explains the tight binding properties of these inhibitors (PMID: 19151923)\n\nIn addition to the 4 prototypic ENR types, recent functional screening of the soil metagenome revealed that a variety of target ENR homologues are responsible for the TCS resistance (PMID: 27577999).  Diverse ENRs similar to 7-&#945;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7-&#945;-HSDH) or the unusual YX7K-type ENR conferred extreme tolerance to TCS. The TCS-refractory 7-&#945; HSDH-like ENR and the TCS-resistant YX7K-type ENR seem to be prevalent in human pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that a selective enrichment occurred in pathogenic bacteria in soil (PMID: 27577999. These additional types of ENR are included in this Subsystem as well, flagged as \"via_metagenomics\"\n\nSurprisingly, nonfunctional FabV and FabK ENR homologues with moderate TCS resistance were described by Khan R. and colleagues (PMID: 27577999). They proposed that the FabK-like and FabV-like ENR homologues, which lack conserved FAD-binding domain and/or catalytically active residues, although devoid of ENR activity, may still act as biocide load reducers by binding and sequestering a certain amount of TCS, thereby reducing the overall biocide burden of the functional ENR in bacterial cells. \n\nIn addition to being targeted by TCS, ENRs are also targeted by a variety of other clinically important antibiotics and antimicrobials, such as Isoniazid (PMID: 18193820), the soon to be marketed AFN-1252 (PMID:24189061), hexachlorophene, diflufenican, and various other antimicrobials. Some mutations in the active sites of ENRs, such as the substrate- and cofactor-binding domains, lead to tolerance of the ENR inhibitors (PMID:27577999).\n\n"},

        "description":"Variant codes:\r\n\r\n 1 = organism contains a clear homolog of RelA or/and SpotT enzyme\r\n-1 = no RelA or SpoT homologs can be asserted in a genome\r\n\r\nThe stringent response is a temporary inhibition of the synthesis of rRNA and tRNA when the cells are (i) starved for an amino acid, or (ii) are under carbon and energy limitation.  It is mediated by signaling molecules guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and, to a lesser extend, guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp), which together are referred to as (p)ppGpp.  \r\nSynthesis of (p)ppGpp in E. coli occurs in two ways.  One route is mediated by RelA, a (p)ppGpp synthetase I - ribosome associated protein, which catalyzes the transfer of a pyrophosphoryl group from ATP to either GTP or GDP, producing pppGpp or ppGpp in response to ribosome �idling�.  This happens when a ribosome is stalled due to insufficient supply of aminoacylated tRNA, caused by the starvation for amino acid(s).  In E. coli the pppGpp, generated by RelA, is subsequently degraded to ppGpp by Guanosine-5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate pyrophosphatase, encoded by the gpp gene.  \r\n\r\nThe cellular level of (p)ppGpp is influenced also by its degradation, catalyzed by guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase SpoT\r\n\r\nThe second, RelA independent pathway of (p)ppGpp biosynthesis is mediated by SpoT protein.  SpoT is believed to be a bifunctional enzyme, that both, synthesizes and degrades (p)ppGpp.  The ratio of biosynthesis and degradation is somehow regulated by carbon and energy limitation (reviewed in refs. 1, 2)\r\n\r\nSituation in Archaea is very different.  According to (Cellini et al., 2004):  (p)ppGpp appears to be completely absent from the Archaea and thus constitutes an additional feature that distinguishes the Bacteria from the Archaea.  However, (1) stringency is widespread in wild-type thermoacidophilic archaea; (2) in the crenarchaeal species stringent control (SC) depends on the deaminoacylation of tRNA; (3) in the strains analyzed ppGpp is not produced during normal growth nor during the stringent reaction; it is therefore not an effector either of SC over sRNA synthesis or of growth control (Cellini et al., 2004)\r\n\r\nSeveral AUXILIARY Functional Roles were included in this Subsystem based merely on the conserved co-localization of the corresponding genes with relA or spoT.  Notably, phosphoribosyltransferase, which catalyzes reversible transfer of the phosphoribosyl group from 5-phospho--D-ribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to adenine (or guanine, or hypoxanthine) is located in the vicinity of relA homologs (and spoT - to a lesser extend) in many diverse genomes.\r\n",

The main structural component of this molecule is a large lactone ring to which amino and/or neutral sugars are attached by glycosidic bonds.\r\n    Macrolides have a similar mode of antibacterial action and comparable antibacterial spectra as two other antibiotic classes, i.e., lincosamides and streptogramins B. Consequently, these antibiotics, although chemically distinct, have been grouped together as Macrolide�Lincosamide�Streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics (Roberts, 2002). Recently this class of antibiotics was extended due to the development to include synthetic drugs: the ketolides (Zhanel et al., 2002; Ackermann and Rodloff, 2003) and oxazolidinones (Diekema and Jones, 2000), which resulted in the MLSKO family of antibiotics (Roberts, 2008).\r\n    Macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins B inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria (Weisblum, 1995; Roberts, 2002)�\r\n    Bacterial resistance mechanisms to these antibiotics include rRNA methylases, ABC-F type ribosomal protection proteins, efflux pumps, and drug inactivating enzymes (Roberts et al., 1999; Roberts, 2008). The latter group can be further subdivided in esterases, lyases, phosphorylases, and transferases. \r\n    This Subsystem encodes only efflux systems. Three additional Subsystems encode other (MLSKO) resistance mechanisms \r\n",

The psl gene cluster is involved in the production of a mannose-rich matrix material in P. aeruginosa strain ZK2870.

These biofilms aid in the survival in a variety of environments.\r\n\r\nSequence analyses predicted that 2 pel genes encode transmembrane proteins and that five pel genes are involved in carbohydrate processing.

        "notes":["One strategy for bacterial adaptation is to self-encapsulate with matrix material, primarily composed of secreted extracellular polysaccharides. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  has the genetic capacity to produce at least three secreted polysaccharides; alginate, Psl, and Pel. These polysaccharides differ in chemical structure and in their biosynthetic mechanisms. Since alginate is often associated with chronic pulmonary infections, its biosynthetic pathway is the best characterized. However, alginate is only produced by a subset of P. aeruginosa strains. Most environmental and other clinical isolates are non-micoid and use either Pel or Psl as the primary matrix structural polysaccharide.  Limited information is available on the biosynthesis of these polysaccharides (reviewed in PMID:21991261, PMID:25438014, PMID:22176658).  It was predicted (in PMID:21991261) that alginate and Pel share certain features, while Psl biosynthesis resembles the EPS/CPS capsular biosynthesis pathway of Escherichia coli, where the Psl pentameric subunits are assembled in association with an isoprenoid lipid carrier.\r\n\r\nFriedman L1, Kolter R. 2004  Genes involved in matrix formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 biofilms.

PVL subunits LukS-PV and LukF-PV are encoded by the lukPV operon [9], carried by the lysogenic phages &#981;SLT, &#981;PVL, &#981;SA2MW and &#981;SA2usa [10,11,12]. A PVL-like operon has been also reported to be formed by LukM/LukF-PV(P83) in the genome of the prophage &#981;P83-pro [48]. LukM/LukF-PV(P83) has been proposed as a virulence factor in mastitis due to sensitivity of ruminants� leukocytes to this toxin [49]; however, a recent report shows the inability of this toxin to induce inflammation in the udder [50]. The association of PVL with the five major pandemic clones of CA-MRSA led to the hypothesis that PVL is the key virulence factor for CA-MRSA necrotizing pneumonia and SSTI [51,52,53]. Epidemiological association between LukED and human disease has been evaluated in a few recent reports. Among other virulence factors, significant association has been reported between LukED expression and S. aureus invasive disease [54,55]. Such association also has been shown for skin dermatitis and furuncles from HIV+ patients [56], impetigo [57], as well as S. aureus-associated diarrhea [58]. Epidemiological studies evaluating association of LukAB with human disease have not been reported. However, a recent report indicates strong neutralizing antibody response to LukAB in pediatric patients with S. aureus invasive disease [59].

VoV1 is present in the membranes of yeast vacuoles,clathrin-coated vesicles, chromaffine granules (8), lysosomes, and plant vacuoles in eukaryotic cells, and it pumps H+ into vesicles. Like FoF1, the VoV1 is composed of a water-soluble set of subunits (V1) and a membrane-integral set of subunits (Vo). The two major A and B subunits and other minor subunits comprise the V1 domain. The A and B subunits are homologous to the  and  subunits of FoF1. By analogy to F1, V1 has also been proposed to have a central shaft subunit that rotates in the A3B3 hexagon. However, an equivalent subunit with indisputable sequence homology to the F1 subunit has not been identified in VoV1. The hydrophobic Vo is thought to be composed of at least five different subunits. The 16-kDa proteolipid subunit containing four transmembrane domains is the major subunit of Vo. Unlike FoF1, V1 dissociates into individual subunits with concomitant loss of ATPase activity, and Vo does not show activity as a H+ channel by itself once V1 is detached from Vo. \r\nBased on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE),1 the isolated T. thermophilus VoV1 has been thought to be composed of eight kinds of polypeptides with the following apparent molecular sizes: 100, 66, 56, 38, 30, 24, 13, and 12 kDa.

        "description":"The Mar operon (for 'Multiple Antibiotic Resistance') is a clinically important regulatory locus in some Enterobacteriaceae controlling expression of over 60 genes, including upregulation of multidrug efflux systems and downregulation of porins.  MarA  is a transcriptional activator (PMID: 8383113), which participates in controlling several genes involved in resistance to antibiotics, multidrug efflux (PMID:20211899), oxidative stress, organic solvents [White97], and heavy metals (PMID: 10498949).  MarA is unstable due to proteolysis, providing rapid shut-off of the transcriptional response once the inducing conditions have subsided.  The repressor MarR is auto-regulated through the repression of the marRAB operon. MarB is part of the marRAB operon, it encodes a small putative protein of unknown function. \r\n\r\nTwo other proteins in E.coli, SoxS and Rob, are related to MarA. SoxS and Rob are dual transcriptional regulators (PMID:1400156, PMID:9324261).  These 3 proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes, the marA/soxS/rob regulon, involved in antibiotic resistance, superoxide resistance , and tolerance to organic solvents and heavy metals (PMID:12067348). The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate (PMID: 12791142), and the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate (PMID:11395452) and oxidative stress (PMID:8955629, respectively. Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; but some genes are regulated by only one of them.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nRuiz C1, Levy SB. 2010.

        "notes":["E.coli isolates highly resistant to fluoroquinolone often carry mutations in marR gene, which result in overproduction of the MarA activator of acrAB transcription (PMID:9687412). The strong overexpression of MarA was also found in most levofloxacin-resistant clinical strains from Japan (PMID:21048014), and the overexpression of AcrA/AcrB was correlated with high levels of norfloxacin resistance among clinical isolates from the United States (PMID:21098250). Since MarA represses the expression of the larger channel porin OmpF (PMID:10498949), the downregulation of OmpF in some strains might have been caused in this manner. Among isolates resistant to amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, and quaternary ammonium disinfectants, TolC overproduction was common, and this appeared to be caused by MarA or SoxS overproduction (PMID:22904241).\r\n"],

        "description":"EcsAB transporter, present in Bacillus and many other Gram(+) microorganisms, has been grouped in a subfamily of extruders related to antibiotic-resistance systems, with similarities to possible efflux pumps for peptide antibiotics (Quentin et al., 1999).   The actual substrate for EcsAB and its function is unknown, but it was hypothesized (Heinrich et al., 2008) that it transports peptides, possibly peptides that insert into the cytoplasmic membrane.  It has been also suggested, that EscAB performs dual signal transduction functions affecting expression of secreted proteins as well as their secretion (Leslkela et al., 1999).  Mutations in EcsA and EcsB cause a pleiotropic phenotype, including defects in competence development, sporulation and in formation biofilms.  The most interesting phenotype of an EcsA-negative mutant is its inability to properly secrete alpha-amylase AmyQ.  The preAmyQ precursor protein remains cell-associated but is accessible to tryptic digestion in protoplasts, pointing to a defect in its processing by signal peptidases.\r\n    Lack of EcsC function is not essential for the function of Ecs.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nHeinrich J, Lund�n T, Kontinen VP, Wiegert T.

        "notes":["adapted from the subsystem \"Lactose and Galactose Uptake and Utilization\" by OlgaZ\r\nStaphylococcus aureus cannot hydrolyse lactose directly. Instead, it has an enzyme, phospho-beta-galactosidase, that hydrolytically cleaves the phosphorylated derivative of lactose into glucose and galactose-6-phosphate. Staphylococcus aureus transports lactose and galactose across the membrane and into the cell by a phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system, during which, lactose and galactose are phosphorylated respectively to lactose-6-phosphate, and galactose-6-phosphate. \r\n\r\n  Staphylococcus aureus degrades D-galactose-6-phosphate via the D-tagatose-6-phosphate pathway, a series of three reactions, analogous to the first three reactions of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway for D-glucose-6-phosphate metabolism. The enzymes catalyzing the reactions in the D-tagatose-6-phosphate pathway:\r\n D-galactose-6-phosphate isomerase, \r\nD-tagatose-6-phosphate kinase,\r\nand D-tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase \r\nwere partially purified and characterized.\r\n\r\n\r\n=========Variant codes:=============\r\n\r\n1.0 - Lactose and galactose uptake by lactose permease and degradation (lac operon + gal);\r\n2.0 - uptake and degradation of lactose by Staphylococcus way (cleaves the phosphorylated derivative of lactose into glucose and galactose-6-phosphate);\r\n3.0 - lactose and galactose uptake and degradation in both ways (Streptococcus pneumoniae);\r\n4.0 - Galactose uptake and degradation only\r\nW - Lactose and galactose uptake by lactose permease and degradation (lac operon + gal) (with some to many genes missing);\r\nX - LacC, *LacZ, GalE only;\r\nY - 1 or 2 genes missing for lactose and galactose utilization;\r\nZ - Tagatose utilization pathway only.\r\n A cluster containing five similarly oriented genes involved in the metabolism of galactose via the Leloir pathway in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 was cloned and characterized. The order of the genes is galPMKTE, and these genes encode a galactose permease (GalP), an aldose 1-epimerase (GalM), a galactokinase (GalK), a hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GalT), and a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (GalE), respectively. This genetic organization reflects the order of the metabolic conversions during galactose utilization via the Leloir pathway. The functionality of the galP, galK, galT, and galE genes was shown by complementation studies performed with both Escherichia coli and L. lactis mutants. The GalP permease is a new member of the galactoside-pentose-hexuronide family of transporters.\r\n\r\n=======From (Ref.1)�Global analysis of carbohydrate utilization by Lactobacillus acidophilus using cDNA microarrays.�:=========\r\n\r\n  In the presence of lactose and galactose, 10 genes distributed in two loci were differentially expressed, namely La1463 [LacS, permease of the galactoside-pentose hexuronide (GPH) translocator family], La1462 (LacZ, beta-galactosidase), La1461 (conserved hypothetical protein), La1460 (surface protein), La1459 (GalK, galactokinase), La1458 (GalT, galactose-1 phosphate uridylyl transferase), La1457 (GalM, galactose epimerase), La1467�La1468 (LacLM, beta-galactosidase large and small subunits), and La1469 (GalE, UDP-glucose epimerase). LacS is similar to GPH permeases previously identified in lactic acid bacteria. \r\n Although LacS contains a EIIA at the carboxy terminus, it is not a PTS transporter. In addition, LacS includes a His at position 560, which might be involved in interaction with HPr, as shown in Streptococcus salivarius. In the presence of lactose and galactose, galKTM was induced between 3.7- and 17.6-fold; lacSZ was induced between 2.8- and 17.6-fold; lacL and galE were induced between 2.7 and 29.5 when compared with other carbohydrates not containing galactose, i.e., glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, and FOS. These results suggest that lactose is transported into the cell via the LacS permease. Inside the cell, lactose is hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose by LacZ. Galactose is then phosphorylated by GalK into galactose-1 phosphate and further transformed into UDP-galactose by GalT. UDP-galactose is subsequently epimerized to UDP-glucose by GalE. UDP-glucose is likely turned into glucose-1 phosphate by La1719 (GalU), which encodes a UDP-glucose phosphorylase that is consistently highly expressed. Finally, the phosphoglucomutase (La687), also highly expressed, likely acts on glucose-1 phosphate to yield glucose-6 phosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n===============REFERENCES:=================================\r\n\r\n1.

Besides mediating cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface adhesion in biofilms, PGA is essential for the formation of the cellular architecture of the biofilm microstructure and for conversion from temporary polar cell surface attachment to permanent lateral attachment during the initial stages of biofilm development. PGA has profound effects on host-microbe interactions, affecting colonization, virulence, and immune evasion.\r\n\r\nSynthesis of poly-&#946;-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine requires the pgaABCD operon.

        "description":"Subsystem under construction\r\nNote that the \"absence\" of tmRNA in a number of genomes is not meaningful and is due for the large part to the fact that this RNA feature has not been called  in a genome. Such omissions can't be corrected at the moment, since manual RNA editing is not supported currently in SEED. \r\n\r\nQuoting (Keiler, 2007):\r\nIn bacteria, translating ribosomes frequently reach the end of an mRNA without terminating at a stop codon. In fact, translation of mRNAs that are truncated because of premature termination of transcription, partial degradation, or physical or chemical damage is an unavoidable consequence of co-transcriptional translation. These �nonstop� mRNAs lack translation termination signals, and there is no obvious way to release ribosomes when they reach the 30 end; ribosomes that have stalled at the end of an mRNA are stable in vitro. In vivo, stalled complexes are released so efficiently that the underlying mechanisms are just coming to light, although there are over 13 000 stalling events per cell in each generation (Moore and Sauer, 2005).  Clearly, the cell needs to maintain a pool of active ribosomes for new translation, and the ribosomes would be rapidly titrated out of this pool if they could not be released from nonstop mRNAs. In addition, release of incomplete proteins can be toxic to the cell, clogging the chaperone and proteolysis pathways and generating detrimental activities. To combat these problems, all bacteria contain the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system for efficiently releasing stalled ribosomes and targeting incomplete proteins and mRNAs for degradation.  tmRNA is not only universally conserved (Gueneau de Novoa et al., 2004), but is also one of the most abundant RNAs in the cell, and is important for normal physiology in many species.\r\n\r\nThe tmRNA tagging system tmRNA uses a unique structure to form a ribonucleoprotein complex and interact with stalled ribosomes. The 5-prime and 3-prime ends of tmRNA fold into a structure resembling alanyl-tRNA, and the 3-prime end is charged with alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetase.  However, tmRNA lacks an anticodon stem-loop and is significantly larger than a tRNA, and the remainder of the molecule contains an open reading frame encoding a short peptide tag.  Similar to other small regulatory RNAs, there is little identity in tmRNA sequences from distantly related bacteria. However, the alanyl-tRNA-like structure is conserved and most sequences are predicted to contain three to four pseudo-knots.  The encoded peptide tags vary in length from 8�35 residues. Most tag sequences begin with alanine and end with two alanine residues, but other positions are not widely conserved.  tmRNA is bound by SmpB, a small protein that is required for tmRNA structure, stability, and interaction with the ribosome.  Similar to tmRNA, SmpB is present in all known species of bacteria, and in all reported cases the phenotype of cells lacking SmpB is identical to those lacking tmRNA. Alanyl-tmRNA is also bound by EF�Tu in the same manner as a tRNA [11,12].  Other proteins co-purify with the tmRNA/SmpB/EF�Tu complex, but the functional significance of these interactions is unclear. \r\n\r\nThe model for tmRNA activity:\r\nThe alanyl- tmRNA/SmpB/EF�Tu complex enters the  A site of ribosomes stalled at the end of an mRNA, acting like a tRNA.  The nascent protein is transferred to alanyl-tmRNA, and the peptidyl-tmRNA-SmpB complex is translocated to the P site, placing the tag reading frame in the mRNA channel of the ribosome and releasing the damaged mRNA.  Translation resumes on the tmRNA open reading frame and terminates at a stop codon, releasing the nascent protein with the tmRNA-encoded tag at its C-terminus. The efficient dissociation of ribosomes from tmRNA ensures that they can be rapidly recycled for productive translation. In addition to releasing the ribosome, tmRNA activity targets the nascent protein for degradation.  The tmRNA-encoded peptide contains epitopes for proteases found in each compartment of the cell, ensuring that the tagged protein will be rapidly degraded if it is released into tagged protein will be rapidly degraded whether it is released into the cytoplasm, translocated into the membrane or exported to the periplasm��\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nKeiler KC.

We report the molecular identification of the eukaryotic dehydratase that repairs these nucleotides and show that this enzyme (Carkd in mammals, YKL151C in yeast) catalyzes the dehydration of the S form of NADHX and NADPHX, at the expense of ATP, which is converted to ADP. Surprisingly, the Escherichia coli homolog, YjeF, a bidomain protein, catalyzes a similar reaction, but using ADP instead of ATP. The latter reaction is ascribable to the C-terminal domain of YjeF. This represents an unprecedented example of orthologous enzymes using either ADP or ATP as phosphoryl donor. We also show that eukaryotic proteins homologous to the N-terminal domain of YjeF (apolipoprotein A-1-binding protein (AIBP) in mammals, YNL200C in yeast) catalyze the epimerization of the S and R forms of NAD(P)HX, thereby allowing, in conjunction with the energy-dependent dehydratase, the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX. Both enzymes are very widespread in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archaea, which together with the ADP dependence of the dehydratase in some species indicates the ancient origin of this repair system.\r\n\r\n",

        "notes":["Lysogeny is widespread among Listeria strains.  Nine putative prophages and 5 monocins (=defective or satellite prophages) have been identified in the five completely sequenced Listeria genomes available to-date.  Five of the 9 putative prophages are very similar to the bacteriophage A118, a L. monocytogenes serovar 1/2a-specific typing phage (Nelson et al., 2004).  A118 is a temperate bacteriophage with a long flexible non-contractile tail and isometric capsid.  The virus was induced by UV irradiation from L. monocytogenes SV strain isolated from Camembert soft cheese (Loessner and Busse, 1990).  It belongs to the Siphoviridae family of ds-DNA phages in the order of Caudovirales.  The A118 genome is a linear, circularly permutated, terminally redundant collection of ds DNA molecules ~40,8 kb long, which has been sequenced (Loessner et al., 2000).  \r\n\r\nThe A118-like prophages described in this SS have been detected in the 4 out of 5 sequenced Listeria genomes (with the exception of E. monocytogenes F2365).  All prophages (with one exception) have inserted into comK, the known target for integration of the typing phage A118 (Nelson et al., 2004).  Surprisingly, in L. innocua one of the two prophages has inserted into the tRNA-Lys-4 gene (Nelson et al., 2004).  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the 5 related A118-like prophages, the phage A118 genome has been included in this SS as well.  It contains ~70 ORFs , organized in a life cycle-specific manner into at least 3 major transcriptional units (Loessner et al., 2000).  Note, that the prophage genomes are permutated as compared to A118 due to recombination of the attachment site attP (located between ORFs gp30 and gp31 on the linear bacteriophage chromosome) with attB (located in the host comK gene) during lysogenezation.  \r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n 1: a single copy of the A118 prophage inserted in the comK gene is present in a genome\r\n 2: two copies of the A118-like prophage are present, one inserted in comK, the other � in the tRNA-Lys-4 gene\r\n 9: strain does not contain a A118 prophage\r\n\r\n \r\nReferences\r\n\r\nNelson KE, Fouts DE, Mongodin EF, et al., and Fraser CM.  2004.

        "description":"The MdtABC-TolC efflux pump is unusual among the tripartite drug efflux transporters of the RND type because it contains two different inner membrane transporter proteins, MdtB and MdtC (not one), which appear to function only as a B2C heterotrimer (PMID: 20038594), whereas typical RND transporters are homotrimers.  When overexpressed, it pumps out norfloxacin, novobiocin, cloxacillin, and deoxycholate (PMID: 25788514).  MdtABC also confers resistance against bile salt derivatives and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).  Site-directed fluorescein maleimide modification studies suggest that MdtC binds the substrate, but MdtB probably functions in other ways, such as initiating the conformational alteration for drug efflux (PMID: 22559837) \r\nThe outer membrane (OM) channel of this tripartite pump can vary: in most genomes a specific OM channel is encoded in the same operon with MdtABC (e.g. in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1), while in E. coli, for example, TolC (encoded elsewhere) performs this role. \r\n\r\nPartial homotrimer assembly MdtAC was shown to confer bile salt, but not novobiocin, resistance (PMID: 12107133) suggesting that the MdtC homomultimeric RND exporter may represent an evolutionally earlier version of the exporter which, with the addition of MdtB gained an increased range of resistance.  However, encoding this Subsystem across multiple microbial taxa revealed a well formed branch of MdtB-like proteins that invariably occur in a putative operon: MdtA+MdtB-like in the absence of an MdtC ortholog in its vicinity (e.g. fig|224911.1.peg.277 in Bradyrhizobium japonicum) or anywhere in the genome (e.g. fig|639283.3.peg.3763 in Starkeya novella) (follow the links to alignments and trees from the corresponding PEG pages to view). This variant is especially common in genomes of Alphaproteobacteria and (less) Betaproteobacteria.  We hypothesize that putative homotrimer �MdtB-like� RND exporter could, in fact, be the evolutionally earlier version that gave rise to the MdtBC heterotrimer via gene duplication event.\r\n\n",

This is a classic monooxygenase reaction in which two reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H are utilized to split the O-O bond of O2. One atom is reduced to water by a 2 e- reduction and the second is incorporated into the substrate to yield methanol\r\n\r\nCH4 + O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ -> CH3OH + NAD(P)+ + H2O\r\nMMOs from different organisms can be of broad specificity and also hydroxylate cyclic alkanes and aromatic compounds.\r\n\r\nThere are two well-studied forms of MMO: the soluble form (sMMO) and the particulate form (pMMO). The active site in sMMO contains a di-iron center bridged by an oxygen atom (Fe-O-Fe), whereas the active site in pMMO utilizes copper, although some propose that pMMO also uses iron.\r\nThe soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) is a multicomponent enzyme system required for the conversion of methane to methanol. It comprises a hydroxylase, a regulatory protein, and a reductase.

It is a very non-specific oxygenase and, in some of its catalytic properties, apparently resembles the analogous enzyme from Methylomonas methanica but differs from those found in Methylosinus trichosporium and Methylomonas albus. 3. CO is oxidized to CO2. 4. C1-C8 n-alkanes are hydroxylated, yielding mixtures of the corresponding 1- and 2-alcohols; no 3- or 4-alcohols are formed. 5. Terminal alkenes yield the corresponding 1,2-epoxides. cis- or trans-but-2-ene are each oxidized to a mixture of 2,3-epoxybutane and but-2-en-1-ol with retention of the cis or trans configuration in both products; 2-butanone is also formed from cis-but-2-ene only. 6. Dimethyl ether is oxidized. Diethyl ether undergoes sub-terminal oxidation, yielding ethanol and ethanal in equimolar amounts. 7. Methane mono-oxygenase also hydroxylates cyclic alkanes and aromatic compounds. However, styrene yields only styrene epoxide and pyridine yields only pyridine N-oxide. 8. Of those compounds tested, only NADPH can replace NADH as electron donor.\r\n\r\nfrom   Colby J et al.

Electron transfer from protein C, the reductase component, to protein A, the hydroxylase component, was demonstrated. Protein C was shown to undergo a three-electron--one-electron catalytic cycle. Protein B was shown to prevent electron transfer between protein C and protein A in the absence of methane.\r\nfrom PMID: 2497729\r\n\r\n=====================\r\n"],

        "notes":["==============OVERVIEW:=============================================================================\n  \n Ubiquinone (UQ)is constituted of a quinone structure and a side chain isoprenoid. The side chain length of UQ differs between microorganisms.\n    Abbreviations are Q or Q-n where �n� refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. E. coli contains Q-8 (n=8, a 40 carbon isoprenoid side chain) as the predominant quinone with minor amounts of Q-1 to Q-7 and Q-9. The predominant side chain length is a constant depending on the species.\n Homo sapiens, Rhodobacter capsulatus, E. coli, and the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae have side chain lengths of n=10, 9, 8, and 6, respectively.\n   Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes contain the benzoquinone, ubiquinone, as the sole quinone, while the facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli contain the naphthoquinones, demethylmenaquinone (DMK) and menaquinone (MK) in addition to ubiquinone. \nThe archaea, as a group, lack ubiquinone. \n  The gram-positive organisms Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces sp. synthesize menaquinones, and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. makes plastoquinone instead of ubiquinone.\n \nStreptococcus  - do not produce Ubiquinone or Menaquinone.\n\nStaphylococcus -  do not produce Ubiquinone but produce Menaquinone, so they have ubiE enzyme.\n\nSynechocystis  - does not contain ubiquinone, but uses plastoquinone both for respiration and for photosynthesis. Nevertheless, the genes specific for enzymes of the ubiquinone pathway are still present. \n\n\n   Yeast seems to produce 4-hydroxybenzoate by two different ways ( see ref#1). It may be produced directly from chorismate by the chorismate pyruvate-lyase reaction similar to E. coli, or alternately from tyrosine, similar to higher eukaryotes. In animal cells, 4-hydroxybenzoate is formed from the essential amino acid tyrosine. \n  Consistent with the existence of two different routes is the fact that yeast mutants blocked in the formation of 4-hydroxybenzoate have never been isolated. Evidence for the presence of the two alternate routes was obtained using shikimate pathway mutants. Mutants blocked in the formation of shikimate or chorismate are expected to be deficient in the formation of Q, due to their inability to form 4-hydroxybenzoate. Addition of tyrosine to the growth medium restored the ability of these mutants to form 4-hydroxybenzoate and Q. \n   It was further shown that wild-type yeast normally uses the conversion of chorismate  to 4-hydroxybenzoate  as the source of precursor for Q.  However, in the shikimate pathway mutants, tyrosine is able to compensate fully by providing the 4-hydroxybenzoate  required for Q biosynthesis. It seems likely that many of the lower eukaryotes that have the shikimate pathway may contain dual pathways for the biosynthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoate.\n\n============Saccharomyces cerevisiae:============================\n\nResently it was shown that the major sequence of CoQ synthesizing enzymes, products of COQ3�COQ8, is organized in a multi-subunit complex in yeast. There are eight modifications of the benzoate ring and only two mammalian genes are isolated and their enzymes partly characterized. Coq3p catalyzes two O-methylations and coq7p catalyzes one hydroxylation. The COQ5 gene has been attributed to the C-methylation of the ring and the COQ6 gene is suggested to be involved in one of the hydroxylations. COQ4 and ABC1/COQ8 have been isolated although their function is unknown.\n\n====Explanation for some functional roles:==================\n\n1. UbiC - The formation of 4-hydroxybenzoate from chorismate is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of UQ. This aromatizing reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme chorismate pyruvate-lyase. The ubiC gene has been overexpressed, and the enzyme purified to homogeneity and characterized.\n\n**** in Mycobacterium:\n  Resently gene Rv2949c (this gene and it's homologs were annotated as hypotetical protein) was establish as a chorismate pyruvate-lyase responsible for the direct conversion of chorismate to p-hydroxybenzoate and identify Rv2949c as the sole enzymatic source of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in M. tuberculosis (see Ref.8)\n\n2. UbiA - 4-Hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. It is responsible for the prenylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate using a polyprenyldiphosphate as a side chain precursor. The enzyme is non-specific and can use a variety of prenyl diphosphates as side chain precursors. The lack of specificity of the enzyme also extends to the aromatic substrate. Thus, the enzyme tolerates substitutions by various groups at different positions on the benzene ring of Q. Smaller amounts of UQs with various side chains are formed in E. coli because the prenyl transferase is relatively non-specific. The prenyl transferase incorporates geranyl-, farnesyl- and solanesyl Ppi into 4-hydroxybenzoate. The UbiA homologue COQ2 from S. cerevisiae also has limited substrate specificity.\n\n3. UbiD, UbiX - 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase catalyzes the third reaction in ubiquinone biosynthesis. There is a second decarboxylase present in E. coli, the ubiX gene product. It is present in much lower levels than the ubiD encoded enzyme. The genes ubiD and ubiX, having no sequence homologies with each other, both encode enzymes with 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate lyase activities in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway (Ref.8). These proteins belong to a select group of approximately 200 isofunctional enzymes in E. coli. The redundancy of UbiD and UbiX proteins, occurring at the third step of the pathway, is both puzzling and intriguing.\n\n ===== The biosynthesis of Q involves at least nine reactions:=================\n\nThree of these reactions involve hydroxylations resulting in the introduction of hydroxyl groups at positions C-6, C-4, and C-5 of the benzene nucleus of Q. The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for these hydroxylations, ubiB, ubiH, and ubiF:\n\n4. UbiB  - ( gene names: ubiB, yigR, fsrC, fre, fadI )-  in E.coli - 2-octaprenylphenol 6-hydroxylase � product of gene ubiB (aarF) is believed to catalyze the first hydroxylation step in the pathway. ubiB was first discovered as a gene encoding flavin reductase . and later identified.\nThe functional role of the ubiB gene product in the hydroxylation of octaprenylphenol is unknown. The ubiB gene does not contain sequence identity corresponding to known monooxygenases in the databases. ubiB shares sequence identity with the ABC1 gene in S. cerevisiae, which is required for function of the mitochondrial bc1 complex. Recently, the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of ABC1 was identified through functional complementation of a yeast ABC1 deletion mutant. Thus, the function of ABC1 in the biosynthesis of CoQ is likely to be conserved. It was shown that Abc1 and Abc1-related proteins are part of a large family of proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Clostridium pasteurianum.\n  Along with ABC1, ubiB is part of a large family of proteins that contain motifs found in eukaryotic-type protein kinases , although it is not known if the protein encoded by ubiB contains kinase activity or what substrates it may act on.\n5. UbiH - In E.coli - 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.-). The COQ6 gene shows sequence similarity to E. coli\nubiH.\n6. UbiG -  In E.coli - 3-demethylubiquinone-9 3-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.64) / 2-octaprenyl-6-hydroxyphenol methylase .The biosynthesis of ubiquinone requires two O-methylation reactions. Recent studies have shown that one O-methyltransferase, identified as UbiG in E. coli and Coq3 in yeast, catalyzes both O-methylation steps in CoQ biosynthesis. The UbiG  and UbiE  amino acid sequences both contain an S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which is shared by some, but not all, methyltransferases.\n7. UbiE - The ubiE gene product, a C-methyltransferase, catalyzes reactions in both ubiquinone (Q) and menaquinone (MK) biosynthesis. Q biosynthesis and MK biosynthesis diverge after the formation of chorismate and the pathways proceed independently except for the C methylation step. In MK biosynthesis the ubiE encoded enzyme catalyzes the conversion of demethylmenaquinone to menaquinone. The corresponding C-methyltransferase in yeast was identified as COQ5 with 44% sequence identity over 262 amino acids to UbiE, which is required for a C-methyltransferase step in the Q and menaquinone biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli. Both the ubiE and COQ5 coding sequences contain sequence motifs common to a wide variety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1. R. Meganathan.

Recent studies have shown that one O-methyltransferase, identified as UbiG in E. coli and Coq3 in yeast, catalyzes both O-methylation steps in CoQ biosynthesis. The UbiG  and UbiE  amino acid sequences both contain an S-adenosylmethionine-binding motif which is shared by some, but not all, methyltransferases.\n7. UbiE - The ubiE gene product, a C-methyltransferase, catalyzes reactions in both ubiquinone (Q) and menaquinone (MK) biosynthesis. Q biosynthesis and MK biosynthesis diverge after the formation of chorismate and the pathways proceed independently except for the C methylation step. In MK biosynthesis the ubiE encoded enzyme catalyzes the conversion of demethylmenaquinone to menaquinone. The corresponding C-methyltransferase in yeast was identified as COQ5 with 44% sequence identity over 262 amino acids to UbiE, which is required for a C-methyltransferase step in the Q and menaquinone biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli. Both the ubiE and COQ5 coding sequences contain sequence motifs common to a wide variety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1. R. Meganathan.

The lysogenic cells appear to be \"addicted\" to the presence of the prophage. The \"plasmid addiction system\" of bacteriophage P1 consists of two proteins: a stable toxin known as Doc (death on cure) and an unstable antidote named Phd (prevent host death).\r\nPhd prevents the lethal action of Doc by forming a tight complex with it. The toxin Doc hosts the C-terminal domain of its antitoxin partner Phd through fold complementation. Phd folds into an {alpha}-helix upon binding to Doc. The complex resembles the Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) proteins. \r\nFree Phd is degraded by the serine protease ClpPX. The cellular target of Doc seems to be a step in protein synthesis.\r\n",

Mutants in which the gene is inactivated or overexpressed exhibite hypersensitivity or resistance, respectively, to the presence of d-cysteine in the culture medium. d-Cysteine desulfhydrase from E. coli is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme. It catalyzes the &#945;,&#946;-elimination reaction of d-cysteine and of several d-cysteine derivatives, providing a detoxification function.  \r\n\r\nDecomposition of d-cysteine by the desulfhydrase produces H2S, which the bacterium can utilize as a sulfur source. In agreement with an involvement in sulfur metabolism, sulfate starvation induces expression of the desulfhydrase.  The desulfhydrase appears in a cluster with three genes, encoding subunits of the L-cystine/L-cysteine transporting ABC complex.  The periplasmic cystine-binding protein and the desulfhydrase are both induced under sulfate starvation and appear to be cotranscribed.\r\n\r\nE. coli K-12 contains a second cystine transporter encoded by ydjN. Inhibition assays suggest that the FliYYecSC transporter has a greater substrate range than YdjN.  L-cysteine may be the preferred substrate for the FliYYecSC transporter (Deutch et al., 2014)\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nKertesz MA1. 2001.

        "description":"Teicoplanin and vancomycin are the drugs of choice against multidrug-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Their antibacterial activity is based on the ability to bind the terminal d-alanyl-d-alanine present in the lipid-II-linked peptidoglycan precursor and in peptidoglycan intermediates, thereby inhibiting transglycosylation and transpeptidation of the cell wall. Though both drugs interact with the same target, teicoplanin anchors to the membrane while vancomycin forms dimers to increase its activity. Even though teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against staphylococci, resistance to teicoplanin is more easily acquired than resistance to vancomycin. In contrast to the van gene-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, resistance in S. aureus is not due to acquisition of foreign elements but formed endogenously. \r\nThe rsbUVW,and sigB operon had been proposed to contribute to teicoplanin resistance, but later rejected with the insight that a sigma(B)-controlled gene might be the actual source of teicoplanin resistance. We propose the paralog of tcaB present in Staphylococcus aureus genomes to play this role.\r\n1. Target organisms:  Staphylococci, enterococci\r\n2. Mechanism of action: \r\n3.

Inhibition of dihydrofolate reduction can be negated by overexpression of the target DfrA or by overexpression of the alternative reductase RibD (blue). \r\n(D) Inactivation of the thymidylate synthase ThyA.

The second\r\ntransfer of the methyl group, to coenzyme M, reduces the enzyme back to the Co(I) form, and is coupled\r\nto the transfer of the sodium ion.\r\n\r\nDuring growth on H2, coenzyme F420 can be reduced by Coenzyme F420 hydrogenase\r\n(EC 1.12.98.1).\r\n\r\nThere are two known paths for reduction of methanophenazine to methanophenazine-H2:\r\nMethanophenazine hydrogenase (EC 1.12.98.3) and F(420)H(2) dehydrogenase.\r\nEach is also accompanied by the consumption of 2 H+ from the cell interior and the\r\nrelease of 2 H+ on the cell exterior.  (There are hints for a pathway involving reduction\r\nby ferredoxin.)\r\n\r\nArchaeoglobus fulgidus does not perform methanogenesis, but runs most of the pathway in reverse\r\nto oxidize one carbon units.  The same steps are run in reverse for the methyl disproportionation\r\npathway.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that \"N5-methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme M methyltransferase subunit X\"\r\nis actually a subunit of the enzyme.  It is conserved among methanogens, and found nowhere else.\r\nHence is here.\r\n\r\nDetailed notes on assignments:\r\n\r\nTetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase subunit F (EC 2.1.1.86) (= mtrF) is a bit muddled.\r\nIt is related to the carboxy-terminal ~60 amino acids of mtrA (the gene immediately upstream).\r\nIn Methanococcus maripaludis, it appears that the only copy of the sequence is associated with the\r\nsecond copy of a tandemly duplicated mtrA gene.  This fusion replaces the carboxy-terminus of the\r\nmtrA gene.\r\n\r\nMcrE was added to the methylcoenzyme M reductase operon by BarnyW because it is divergently transcribed from all the mcrI operons.  Although its function is not known, a logical role would be the posttranslational modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"]},

        "description":"1. De novo pathway\r\nFungi and plants, as well as most bacteria, have the full THF biosynthesis pathway (variant 111). In E. coli and S. cerevisiae, genes have been identified for all but one step of the pathway, the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate to the corresponding monophosphate (folQ); removal of the last phosphate is believed to be mediated by a non-specific phosphatase (J. Biol. Chem. 1974 249:2405-10).\r\n\r\nMissing and alternative genes\r\nA folQ gene was recently identified in L. lactis (J. Biol. Ch: em. 2005 280:5274-80) as part of the folKEPQC gene cluster (Type 1 in the SS). This gene belongs to a large and functionally heterogeneous Nudix hydrolase superfamily hardly amenable to projection of annotations just by homology. Recently the FolQ of E. coli was identified by Bessman and col. (Structure. 2007 Aug;15(8):1014-22) annotated as type 2 here. There again the annotation cannot be propagated to far. Several Nudix hydrolase gene candidates can be identified in folate gene clusters, and these should be tested experimentally. Other putative phosphohydrolases unrelated to FolQ are found in some of the folate-related gene clusters, e.g., peg1083 in Clostridium perfringens. R\r\n\r\nDHFR\r\nDHFRs are known to be encoded by several gene families. In addition to the most common folA family, a pteridine reductase-like folM (�DHFR1� in our subsystem; J. Bacteriol. 2003 185:7015-8), and a flavin-dependent reductase (�altDHFR2�; Mol. Microbiol. 2004 54:1307-18) have been identified. DHFR1 enzymes belong to the large superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases-reductases (SDR) involved in a variety of reactions. A FolM-specific sequence motif TGXXXRXG was used to discriminate DHFR1 subfamily from other SDRs (featuring a TGXXXGXG motif). The FolM enzyme is involved in the reducation of dihydroMonapterin (J Bacteriol. 2010 Jan;192(2):475-82).  Even after propagation of all known DHFR families, respective genes are still missing in several organisms (see variant 006,106,116). One gene candidate (altDHFR3) is embedded in the FolEKPB gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor. This prediction was made by A. Hanson and it is currently being tested in his laboratory.\r\n\r\nGCYHI\r\nGTP cyclohydrolase I is the first step of the folate pathway (annotated as type 1). It is found in mammals that have a biopterin (BH4) pathway, but it is still a missing gene in many species containing an otherwise complete set of folate biosynthetic genes. A  second gene family (GCYHIB annoated as type 2) was identified by genome context analysis techniques in conjunction with a tRNA modification pathway (see comments to Queuosine-Archaeosine Biosynthesis subsystem) (El YAcoubi et al.,J Biol Chem. 2006 Dec 8;281(49):37586-93.  Several organisms are still lacking either form of GCYHI (see variant 702,701).\r\n\r\nDHNA \r\nHomologs of folB gene (encoding DHNA) appear to be missing in many organisms. Genome and functional context analysis allowed A. Hanson to infer that this role may be played by some homologs of E. coli fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (�FSA� in subsystem, This prediction is weaker now that other  aldolase genes are being found (see below).  Recent work in Plasmodium has shown that the aldolase activity is carried by a  6-pyruvoyl tetrahydrobiopterin synthase (EC 4.2.3.12) like enzyme that acts directly on H2-neopterin triphosphate and not on H2-neopterin, we call this enzyme for the moment (Folate biosynthesis, PTPS-III). Genome analysis  and experimental validation shows  that PTPS-III type aldolase found in many bacteria replace folB and that some of these PTPS-III have dual actitivity as QueD/PTPS-I involved in Queuosine biosynthesis (Pribat et al 2009 J Bacteriol 191, 4158-4165  and Phillips et al 2012, ACS Chem Biol 7, 197-209 .  Some organisms still lack any DHNA gene candidates (variant 401,411,)\r\n\r\nSome organisms have two folB in cases like  \tBurkholderia xenovorans LB400 one of them might have specialized to methanopterin  . In a few of the methanopterin organisms such as Aurantimonas, FolB is fused to \"duf556 family protein\" a potential methanopterin enzymes (see Methanopterin2 SS\r\nMultiple missing genes\r\n\r\nHPPK\r\n\r\nIn the Roseobacter/Silibacter clade FolB is fused to a domain similar to delta \"1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase\" or a general aminoacid kinase found in Archaea and in methanopterin producers. As one of these organisms lacked FolK I looked in more details at the FolK in this clase and alignments show that there an internal insertion of around 35 aa in all FolK of the genomes that have this fusion FolB protein. The natural hypothesis is that in those organism the gene annotated as FolK does another function and the fusion kinase is the real FolK. \r\n\r\n\r\n-Chlamydiae lack GCYHI and the\r\n DHFS/FPGS \r\nThe sequenced chlamydiae all lack homologs of folC (DHFS/FPGS)  Inspection revealed that a member of gene family COG1478 is clustered in chlamydiae with folate biosynthesis genes.This COG1478 family contains the F420:&#947;-glutamyl ligase CofE of Archaea and Mycobacteria [Biochemistry 2003, 42:9771-9778]. CofE catalyzes the GTP-dependent successive addition of two &#947;-linked L-glutamates to the L-lactyl phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (F420), a reaction analogous to that mediated by FolC. Chlamydiae almost certainly do not make F420 since they lack all the other known cof genes []. We accordingly predicted that the CofE homolog in chlamydiae has FolC activity. A cofE homolog (CT611) was shown to complement the methionine and glycine requirements of the E. coli folC mutant  BMC Genomics. 2007 Jul 23;8:245. FolC2 was named \"Alternative Folylglutamate Synthase\" in the SS.\r\n\r\n: \r\n- A few organisms lack both DHNA and HPPK genes (variants 3)\r\n2. Salvage pathways\r\nThe most studied salvage pathway is found in mammals and many other eukaryotes have just the DHFR and FPGS enzymes (see variant 1). Many relatively poorly studied bacteria also seem to rely on a salvage pathway. Many pathogenic and related bacteria have only the DHFS, FPGS and DHFR genes (variant 2), suggesting a salvage of 7,8-dihydropteroate. However, this compound is not expected to occur in their natural environment leaving us with an open problem for further studies.\r\nIn Borrelia (nonfunctional variant code �� 1�) no genes of the folate pathway can be detected, in agreement with the presence of the folate-independent thymidylate synthase (TS) of the thyX family. In most Mycoplasmas, DHFR and a folate-dependent TS gene are found, but FPGS appears to be a missing gene (variant 10). These species may salvage mono- or polyglutamylated folates from the host.  A default variant code �0� is retained for those genomes where we were unable to rationalize gene patterns. Many of them are due to incomplete sequencing or sequencing mistakes, or even reflect the existence of pseudogenes\r\n\r\n3. Folate in Archaea.\r\nThe situation in Archaea is even more complicated. Although many methanogens (e.g., M. jannaschii) produce tetrahydromethanopterin instead of folate (hence variant code �-1�), they contain homologs of some folate-related genes, likely reflecting a resemblance between some steps in the biosynthesis of these two cofactors. For example, a FolP-like gene family (FolP2, MJ0107) found mostly in Archaea, may be involved in methanopterin biosynthesis (M. Rasche, personal communication). On the other hand, the ThyA-like TS enzyme of M. jannaschii was shown to utilize folate rather than methanopterin derivatives as a cofactor (Nature Struct. Biol. 1999 6:750-4. This observation may indicate an existence of: (i) an alternative folate biosynthetic pathway, or (ii) an unidentified methanopterin-related methyl donor. In both cases one should anticipate an existence of an alternative reductase in those genomes that lack DHFR homologs. Several archaeal genomes (Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma, variant 13) containing almost all of the de novo pathway genes, lack recognizable homologs of DHFR and HPPK. Finally, one of the several archaeal species containing both ThyA-like TS and DHFR (variant 12), was shown to be dependent on folate or pABA for growth. Two non ortholgous families were recently identified that functionally replace FolB and FolK  (de Crecy-lagard et al 2012 ACS Chem Biol. 7:1807-16).\r\n"},

The first tetracycline-resistant bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae, was isolated in 1953. It was in fact the inquiry into molecular mechanisms of TET resistance that opened up the entire field of antimicrobial resitance (ISBN 1-55581-329-1) \r\n\r\nTetracycline resistance is most often due to the acquisition of new genes, which encode either (i) energy-dependent efflux of tetracyclines or (ii) a protein that protects bacterial ribosomes from the action of tetracyclines (Chopra and Roberts, 2001). Ribosomal protection proteins and TET efflux pumps are the two main mechanisms of TET resistance. In addition, a limited number of bacteria acquire resistance by mutations, which alter the permeability of the outer membrane porins and/or lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane, change the regulation of innate efflux systems, or alter the 16S rRNA.  Reviewed in (Chopra and Roberts, 2001)\r\n\r\nOver 40 types of TET resistant determinants have been described so far, and new ones are being reported. Dr. Stuart Levy from Tufts is the clearinghouse for naming new TET genes. A new gene must have <79% amino acid identity with all previous characterized TET genes to be recorded.

CATs are able to inactivate chloramphenicol as well as thiamphenicol and azidamfenicol, but not florfenicol. Consequently, chloramphenicol resistant strains, in which resistance is exclusively based on the activity of CAT, are susceptible to florfenicol. There are two defined types of genes coding CATs which distinctly differ in their structure:  the classical catA determinants and the novel, also known as xenobiotic CATs, encoded by catB variants. \r\n   Besides the inactivating enzymes, other chloramphenicol resistance systems include: inactivation by phosphotransferases, mutations of the target site, permeability barriers, and efflux pumps (Schwarz et al., 2004). Of the latter mechanism, cmlA and floR are the most commonly known (Bissonnette et al., 1991; Briggs and Fratamico, 1999). The presence of a cmlA gene will result in resistance to chloramphenicol, but susceptibility to florfenicol. In contrast, floR will give rise to a chloramphenicol and florfenicol resistance phenotype\"\r\n  In addition, 23S rRNA (adenine(2503)-C(8))-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.224) => Cfr confers resistance to florfenicol and chloramphenicol (in addition to several macrolide antibiotics) (PMID:26149991, PMID:16091044)\r\n\r\n",

        "notes":["   Many studies of VB6 metabolism have been conducted in Escherichia coli and fungi such as Cercospora nicotianae, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n In the case of E. coli, both de novo and salvage pathways have been identified. \n   These two pathways include enzymes encoded by eight genes in total and share only one gene, pdxH. In the de novo pathway, the pyridine ring of VB6 is generated from D-erythrose-4-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. On the other hand, in the salvage pathway, PLP is synthesized without pyridine ring generation. A corresponding de novo pathway has not been discovered in fungi or plants. Instead, fungi were found to have another biosynthetic pathway, the fungal type pathway. This pathway has two genes, SNZ and SNO, whose functions are currently unknown. Therefore, species that synthesize PLP have been reported to have at least one of the three PLP biosynthetic pathways.\n    Database searches revealed (ref. 1, 2) that the key enzymes involved in ring closure of the aromatic pyridoxin ring (PdxA; PdxJ) are present mainly in genomes of bacteria constituting the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. The distribution of DXS, a transketolase-like enzyme involved in vitamin B6 biosynthesis as well as in thiamine and isoprenoid biosynthesis and the distribution of vitamin B6 modifying enzymes (PdxH: oxidase; PdxK: kinase) was also analyzed. These enzymes are also present in the genomes of animals.\n\n***************************!!!*******\n\nOxidation of D-erythrose-4-phosphate to 4-phosphoerythronate is the first step of branch 1 of the de novo pathwayand is catalyzed by the E4P dehydrogenase activities of the GapA and Epd (GapB) enzymes(that proofed in the work of Yang Y.- see Ref.5)\n\n*********************************************\n\nRecently, the alternate pathway of Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) biosynthesis was discovered (ref.8, 9):\n\nTwo proteins, known as PdxS and PdxT, together form a PLP synthase in plants, fungi, archaea, and some eubacteria. PLP synthase is a heteromeric glutamine amidotransferase in which PdxT produces ammonia from glutamine and PdxS combines ammonia with five- and three-carbon phosphosugars to form PLP.\nThe pdxS- and pdxT-like genes are proximal or adjacent to one another in most organisms where the PdxS/PdxT pathway exists.\n  The overall catalytic conversion by PLP synthase is more complex than reactions catalyzed by other glutamine amidotransferases (Ref.9). In addition to ammonia transfer, the enzyme catalyzes condensation of two phosphosugars, closure of the pyridine ring, as well as isomerase reactions for its phosphosugar substrates. The complexity of the enzyme correlates well with the strong conservation of the PdxS sequence. Cross-talk between glutaminase and synthase active sites also appears more complex. Binding of one synthase substrate inhibits the glutaminase activity below basal levels, and full stimulation likely requires binding both phosphosugar substrates.\n\nPdxT � Homologs are known as yaaE, pdx2, PDX2, SNO, and SNZB - Pyridoxine biosynthesis glutamine amidotransferase, glutaminase subunit (EC 2.4.2.-)\n\nPdxS - Homologs are known as yaaD, pdx1, PDX1, SNZ, SOR1, PYROA, and HEVER - Pyridoxine biosynthesis glutamine amidotransferase, synthase subunit (EC 2.4.2.-) \n\n==============================================================================\n\nMissing gene PdxB alternative:\n\nPdxB is missing in a large group of organisms ( Haemophilus, Xylella, Campylobacter).\nWinkler suggests that SerA enzyme acts in a an alternate pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis in pdxB mutants (Ref.6,7).\n\nThis pathway, which parallels the phosphorylated pathway of serine biosynthesis, is predicted on the homology between PdxB and SerA, the structural similarity between serine and 4-hydroxythreonine, and the possible involvement of SerC ( PdxF ) in pyridoxine biosynthesis.\nserA-encoded 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) dehydrogenase catalyzes the first step of the major phosphorylated pathway of L-serine (Ser) biosynthesis. The SerA enzyme is evolutionarily related to the pdxB gene product, 4-phosphoerythronate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the second step in one branch of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate coenzyme biosynthesis. Both the Ser and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthetic pathways use the serC(pdxF)-encoded transaminase in their next steps.\n\n===============================================================================\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.T.

        "description":"DnaK forms chaperone machinery with co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE, which participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured proteins and by disaggregating proteins.  In some species (e.g., in Salmonella enterica) DnaK operon is apparently induced also inside host macrophages during infection (Takaya et al., 2004).  See SS: �Protein chaperons� for details\r\n\r\nThis SS is a collection of poorly characterized genes, which tend to co-localize with the hrcA-dnaK-dnaJ-grpE genes in genomes of various microbial species, and, hence, might also be involved in heat/oxidative stress response.  A stunning example � a large gene cluster preserved in many Firmicutes.  Furthermore, co-expression of three of these hypothetical genes with the hrcA-dnaK-dnaJ-grpE operon has been experimentally demonstrated in B. subtilis (Homuth et al., 1997).  In this SS they are annotated as:\r\nOrf35 (yqeT):  Ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-)\r\nOrf28 (yqeU):  Hypothetical protein DUF558, predicted RNA methyltransferase\r\nOrf50 (yqeV):  MiaB family protein, possibly involved in tRNA or rRNA modification\r\n\r\nAlthough specific functions of these and other genes in conserved cluster with dnaK operon are currently unknown, it is noteworthy that many of them are predicted to be involved in various tRNA or rRNA modifications.  Since many tRNA modifications are believed to improve reading frame maintenance (Urbonavicius et al., 2001), it is tempting to speculate that the role of these additional proteins is protecting ribosomal function (e.g. accuracy of translation) during heat shock and other stresses.  Indeed, MiaB-like enzymes are specifically over-represented in certain thermophiles, such as Thermotoga maritima, Aquifex aeolicus and Methanococcus jannaschii, suggesting that they might additionally participate in some thermophile-specific nucleotide modifications (Anantharaman et al., 2001).   MiaB is a bifunctional radical-S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, an isopentenyl-adenosine tRNA methylthiolase that assists in the prevention of frameshift mutations  (Esberg et al., 1999; Pierrel et al., 2004). It's paralog (not actual MiaB) is often present in this gene cluster.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that these putative additional heat-shock-related proteins are potentially involvement in improving ribosomal function during stress is further supported by the fact that �GTP-binding protein LepA� is often co-localized with these �extended dnaK gene clusters�.  This universally conserved protein has been recently shown to function as an additional elongation factor required for back-translocating posttranslocational ribosomes.  LepA recognizes ribosomes after a defective translocation reaction and induces a back-translocation (giving EF-G a second chance to translocate the tRNAs correctly (Qin et al., 2006))\r\n",

        "notes":["Variant codes (based on predicted regulation of the dnaK and groEL operons, see below):\r\n\r\n 1 = two conditions are met: (i) 5 additional genes cluster with the dnaK operon (as in Firmicutes); (ii) HrcA-CIRCE system is the main (only?) regulator of the dnaK and groEL operons in an organism \r\n\r\n 3 = homologs of the 5 additional genes (if present) are not located in the same cluster with the dnaK operon;  (ii) HrcA-CIRCE system is the main (only?) regulator of the dnaK and groEL operons in an organism \r\n\r\n 2 = repressor HspR is present in addition to HrcA-CIRCE system.  In such genomes homologs of HspR and HrcA are often located in two distinct gene clusters: [HspR-dnaK-grpE-dnaJ] and  [HrcA-dnaJ-RNAmet].  Note, that dnaJ in such organisms is often duplicated.\r\n\r\n 4 = rare: only HspR is present, no HrcA homolog can be detected in a genome \r\n\r\n 5 = no HrcA or HspR repressors can be detected in a genome, induction of heat-shock response is apparently regulated by Sigma-32 (as in Enterobacteriales) or another stress-related Sigma factor\r\n\r\nNumber 2 after the dot  [*.2] indicates the presence of two or more copies of dnaJ protein in a genome.\r\n\r\nRegulation of DnaK and GroEL operons\r\n\r\nIn prokaryotes, two major mechanisms of heat/stress shock induction have been detected and analyzed in great detail in Escherichia  coli and in Bacillus subtilis.  In E. coli and several other Gram(-) species expression of all  major cytoplasmic heat shock proteins is under the positive control of the alternate sigma factor 32 encoded  by the rpoH gene.  Upon a heat shock, the cellular level of sigma-32 increases both by  enhanced translation of rpoH mRNA and by transient  stabilization of sigma-32 , and this increase in turn is responsible for a transient enhanced transcription of heat  shock genes. The level and activity of sigma-32 are negatively regulated in E. coli by the products of the heat shock  genes dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE coding for the DnaK  chaperone machine. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the positive regulation by sigma-32, heat shock expression in the majority of eubacteria is controlled by  negative regulation (for a recent review, see [3]).  A wide-spread negative control mechanism comprises the repressor protein HrcA binding to an operator which has been designated CIRCE (for Controlling Inverted Repeat  of Chaperone Expression).  The HrcA-CIRCE system has been found in Gram-positive bacteria and proteobacteria and implicated in cyanobacteria and several other groups of eubacteria, where it controls the dnaK and groEL operons.  Genes under control of the HrcA-CIRCE system are grouped into so called Class I heat shock genes.   \r\n\r\nAn additional repressor of heat shock genes HspR has been identified in Streptomyces, where it controls the dnaK, but not the groEL operon (Grandvalet et al., 1997).  Thus, in contrast with B. subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria, transcription of Streptomyces dnaK and groEL operons is not controlled by the same regulator.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAnantharaman V., E.V.

        "description":"This subsystem has been initially encoded by master:NeilJ_UCSD and master:MaryP_UCSD, whose contributions we gratefully acknowledge, as \"Homofermentative_lactate_fermentation\" and Heterofermentative_lactate_fermentation.  It is currently curated by SelkovEE and SvetaG.   \r\n\r\nThree major types of lactate fermentations have been described: homofermentation, heterofermentation, and bifidum pathway (schemes are posted under the 'Diagrams and Illustrations' tab above).  Homofermentation is associated with  the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway (see the corresponding SS for details); heterofermentation uses the Pentose Phosphate pathway (see the corresponding SS).  Theoretical ATP yield of homofermentation is 2 ATP molecules per glucose, the yield of heterofermentative pathway is 1 ATP per glucose.  Bifidobacteria perform specific bifidum pathway with net gain of 2.5 ATP molecules per 1 glucose.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presence of Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase is generally considered diagnostic for lactate heterofermentation pathway, in a few organisms containing XPK, no lactate dehydrogenase could be identified (variant code [9] - see below), hence apparently XPK activity is not necessarily associated with production of lactate.  \r\n\r\nThe presence of Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase enzymatic activity is characteristic for the 'bifid shunt' (see two schemes under 'illustrations' tab). There is evidence for the existence of two distinct F6P-phosphoketolase enzymes in bifidobacteria [Meile et al., 2001] - one is specific solely for F6P; the other is less stringent and is able to utilize D-xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P) as an alternative substrate. Both reactions are required for the bifid shunt [Scardovi and Trovatelli, 1965], thus, it makes sense that the same enzyme catalyses both roles in this pathway.  \r\nHowever, since these 2 forms can't be distinguished based on protein sequences alone, all clear XPK/FPK homologs have been annotated as potentially capable of catalyzing both reactions - �Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9); Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22)� probably leading to severe over-annotation.  In an attempt to minimize the damage of it, the XPK/FPK homologs where FPK activity was experimentally demonstrated (in Bifidum species) or could be inferred from genome context (see below) were annotated �Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9) / Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22)�  with a slash �/�.  Also, such organisms were assigned variant codes [_4].  In addition to Bifidobacteria these include Clostridium acetobutylicum and Streptococcus agalactiae where the absence of Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating (EC 1.1.1.44) may necessitate FPK activity in XPK/FPK homolog.\r\n\r\nReferences for the BIFID shunt:\r\n\r\nSuzuki R1, Katayama T, Kim BJ, Wakagi T, Shoun H, Ashida H, Yamamoto K, Fushinobu S.

        "description":"Heme d1 plays a key role in the function the cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (NirS), which catalyzes the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide and water, the first committed step of the denitrification process (encoded in a separate SS: �Dissimilatory nitrite reductase). NirS is the only enzyme known to utilize heme d1 as a cofactor.\r\n\r\nThe unusual pathway for heme d1 biosynthesis was recently deciphered by M. Warren�s group (Bali, et al., 2011).  The fact that heme d1 biosynthetic genes co-localize with NirS and other nir genes in denitrifying bacteria (Palmedo  et al., 1995; Kawasaki  et al., 1997) facilitated this discovery.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, a related process leading to HEME biosynthesis was discovered based on the biochemical data in Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Ishida et al., 1998) and the analysis of completely sequenced Archaeal and Desulfovibrio genomes  (Lobo et al., 2009; Storbeck S, et al., 2010; Panek & O�Brian, 2002).  Altogether, these observations led to the theory of an alternative heme biosynthesis pathway that diverges from the classical pathway at the uroporphyrinogen step via precorrin-2\r\n\r\nThis novel process of heme or heme d1 biosynthesis process entails the hijacking of siroheme, the prosthetic group of sulfite and nitrite reductase [see scheme under 'Diagrams and Illustrations' green tab above].  The initial step in these transformations involves the decarboxylation of siroheme to give didecarboxysiroheme. For d1 heme synthesis this intermediate has to undergo the replacement of two propionate side chains with oxygen functionalities and the introduction of a double bond into a further peripheral side chain. For heme synthesis didecarboxysiroheme is converted into Fe- coproporphyrin by oxidative loss of two acetic acid side chains. Fe-coproporphyrin is then transformed into heme by the oxidative decarboxylation of two propionate side chains \r\n\r\nThe genes controlling the new heme pathway are referred to as ahb genes (for 'Alternative Heme Biosynthesis') A, B, C, and D, and are homologous to nirD, H, and J, respectively (with nirJ being homologous to both ahbC and D)\r\n=== Quoted largely from (Bali et al., 2014)===\r\n\r\nReferences \r\n\r\nBali S, Palmer DJ, Schroeder S, Ferguson SJ, Warren MJ.  2014.

        "notes":["Variant codes:\r\n\r\n 1 = a set of adhesins in S. aureus\r\n 2 = a set of adhesins in S. epidermidis\r\n 3 = in other Staphylococcus species\r\n\r\nStaphylococcus aureus can adhere to components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and plasma of the host to initiate colonization.  Adherence is mediated by: \r\n(i) protein adhesins of the MSCRAMM family (Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules), which in most cases are covalently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan; \r\n(ii) extracellular secreted proteins capable of binding various host plasma and ECM components such as fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, bone sialoprotein and others; \r\n(iii) extracellular polysaccharide termed �poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)� in S. aureus and �polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA)� in S. epidermidis.\r\n\r\nI. Cell-wall-anchored MSCRAMMs have recognizable structure.  A long (~40 amino acids) N-terminal signal sequence is required for Sec-dependent protein secretion.  It is followed by a nonrepetitive domain, largely responsible for ligand binding.  It is followed in turn by a repetitive domains consisting of either long (38-137 aa) repetitive elements, or/and an extended series of Serine-Aspartate (SD) dipeptide repeats.  The C-terminal region (wall-spanning domain �> membrane-spanning domain �> (+) charged cytoplasmic anchor) constitutes a sorting signal, which facilitates incorporation of MSCRAMMs into S. aureus cell wall.  The hallmark of the sorting signal is an LPXTG motif.  The LPXTG motif is cleaved between the Thr and Gly residues by transpeptidase sortase and the carboxyl group of Thr is covalently joined to the carboxyl group of a branch peptide in the peptidoglycan. In the case of S. aureus, this is a pentaglycine sequence. \r\n\r\nMany characterized members of this family are described in detail in the database of Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria at: http://www.mgc.ac.cn/cgi-bin/VFs/genus.cgi?Genus=Staphylococcus\r\nIn addition to well studied MSCRAMMs, several hypothetical S.aureus proteins with a LPXTG (or LPXaG) motif and similar domain architecture (hence, cell-surface-anchored) have been included in this SS (based on Roche et al., 2003).  Although their function is not clear yet, two of them (SasG and SasH) have been significantly associated with in invasive disease isolates (as compared to carriage isolates from healthy donors (Roche et al., 2003)).  These are grouped under the \"*Hyp_surface_proteins\" subset of roles.  Please click \"ignore alternatives\" check-box to view in detail\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Although the role of extracellular binding proteins in Staph infections have been established, it is not necessarily adhesion to host tissues.  For instance, Efb is believed to bind soluble fibrinigen in a manner that delays clot formation and hence delays wound healing (Palma et al., 1996); Eab promotes S. aureus aggregation and enhances internalization into eukaryotic cells (Haggar et al., 2003).  For a review see (1).\r\n\r\nIII. In addition to the protein adhesins, the icaABCD operon (for intercellular adhesion (Heilmann et al., 1996)), encoding the biosynthesis of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is important for adhesion (it is NOT included in this Subsystem, see SS: Biofilm formation in Staphylococcus).  PIA is a partially N-acetylated linear beta-1�6-linked glucosaminoglycan.  It is essential for the second step of biofilm formation - intercellular adhesion or growth-dependent multilayered cell cluster accumulation (the first step being an attachment of bacterial cells to a polymer surface).  PIA is also involved in haemagglutination and acts as an  intercellular adhesin on glass and (probably) other hydrophilic surfaces (refs. 5-8)\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1. M.

The �Spreadsheet� Tab: contains a Table where each row represents a genome, each column corresponds to a Functional Role (protein family), and each cell is populated with the gene(s)/protein(s) that implement this Functional Role in each organism. Each gene/protein is identified with a blue number � the Protein-Encoding Gene (PEG) ID - which is linked to an underlying detailed PEG page.  The Spreadsheet can be sorted: by taxonomy, by the pattern of PEGs absence/presence, or by gene clustering pattern, or alphabetically by organism.  It can also be filtered: pls use \"Limit Display\" Tab on the  �Spreadsheet� page to limit by a specific taxonomic group, OR/AND use column headings to see only genomes with a specific protein family present/absent.  Cells highlighted with the same color within the same row (genome) indicate genes that are co-localized on the chromosome. \r\n\r\nII. The �Functional Roles� Tab: contains the list of protein families included in this Subsystem, and explains abbreviations used in the heading of the Subsystem Spreadsheet.  Note \"Subsets\" (in the leftmost column), which group some Functional Roles together.  Subsets allow to further customize Subsystem Spreadsheet view:  to limit it to columns that are included in a selected SubSet, or to collapse isofunctional protein family into a single column for clearity, eic.  Use \"Limit Display\" tab on the  �Spreadsheet� page to do this\r\n\r\nIII. \"Variant codes\" are assigned to every organism in the Subsystem spreadsheet. They attempt to capture in a brief form the type of heme biosynthesis pathway that can be predicted to operate in this organism based on its genome data, and any notable exceptions or observations. Hover over them in the spreadsheet to read detailed discretion of each code. All Variant codes are also listed below on this page (Under \"Variants\")\r\n\r\nV. The representative set of 982 diverse eubacterial and archaeal genomes is included in this Subsystem. It accurately represents the immense diversity of ~12,000 prokaryotic organisms with sequenced genomes currently in the SEED database, and it is not skewed by an overabundance of genomes for a handful of microbial genera (medically or industrially important) such as Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci, Mycobacteria, etc. \r\n\r\nVI. To limit the Spreadsheet to photosynthetic organisms only please use the right-most Column headings (ChlL or ChlN) and set it to \"non-empty\".

This is a highly\r\nspecialized type of heme found as prosthetic group in cytochrome a-containing respiratory oxidases. Heme A\r\ndiffers structurally from heme B (protoheme IX) by the presence of a hydroxyethylfarnesyl group instead of a vinyl side group at the C2 position and a formyl group instead of a methyl side group at position C8 of the porphyrin macrocycle (use Illustrations Tab above to view scheme). Heme O is hydroxyethylprenylated like heme A, but has a C8 methyl group like heme B (Hederstedt, 2012; Mogi et al., 1994). Heme O serves as a prosthetic group in some terminal oxidases such as Escherichia coli cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase CyoABCD (subunits CyoA and CyoB are included in this Subsystem for context) \r\n\r\nIn Archaea variants of heme A and heme O with an ethenylfarnesyl, ethenylgeranylgeranyl or hydroxygeranylgeranyl C2 side chain were reported (Lubben et al., 1994).

        "description":"This subsystem has been originally encoded by Dr. El Yacoubi, whose contribution to the SEED database we gratefully acknowledge.\r\n\r\nPlant-Prokaryote project SUMMARY for YciO and YciV families (in Arabidopsis: At3g01920 and At2g13840 respectively)\r\n\r\nMost organisms harbor only one member of the YrdC/Sua5 (COG009) protein family.  Exceptions include plants and several bacteria that have two homologs.  Expression of the second COG009 encoding gene of E. coli, yciO, failed to complement the t6A-minus phenotype of yeast strains lacking a functional SUA5 gene (El Yacoubi, et al., 2009).  The two subfamilies can also be distinguished by sequence analysis, as residues K50 and R52 are strictly conserved in the YrdC/Sua5 subfamily but absent in YciO sequences.  These residues are essential for YrdC/Sua5 function as shown by site directed mutagenesis and complementation experiments.  \r\n\r\nTherefore the YciO branch of COG009 is separated in this database from the YrdC and Sua5 subfamilies, as the results presented here suggest that function of the YciO subgroup of COG0009 is distinct from that of YrdC/Sua5 (El Yacoubi, et al., 2009).  It's function is still unknown.\r\n\r\nProtein family YciV appears to be involved in strong functional coupling with the YciO subfamily (as the corresponding genes appear to co-occur and co-localize in the majority of genomes where they are present).  We predict that the YciO and YciV protein families are jointly involved in yet unknown modification of RNA or proteins\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

        "notes":["Plant-Prokaryote project SUMMARY for YrdC-Sua5 family (At5g60590 in Arabidopsis):\r\n\r\nUsing a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, structural and biochemical approaches, the universal protein family YrdC/Sua5 (COG0009) was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the N6-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A) � an anticodon-loop modification found at position 37 of tRNAs decoding ANN codons  (El Yacoubi et al., 2009). \r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS/BACKGROUND:\r\n\r\nN6-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A) is a universal modification found at position 37 of ANN decoding tRNAs, which imparts a unique structure to the anticodon loop enhancing its binding to ribosomes in vitro. Although considerable biochemical and biophysical information exists on the function of this hypermodified base (Elkins et al., 1974; Yarian  et al., 2002; Durant et al., 2005), the t6A biosynthesis pathway has only been partially biochemically characterized and shown to be an ATP-dependent process requiring threonine and carbonate although none of the genes involved in its biosynthesis have been identified.\r\n\r\n1.Analysis of all sequenced tRNAs (38) suggested that all organisms should have a t6A biosynthesis pathway.\r\n\r\n2.The list of orthologous protein families shared between Gram(+) and Gram(-) organisms, including those with severely reduced genomes, yielded only 95 �universal� families, mostly related to translation (ribosomal protein, tRNA synthetases and tRNA modification).\r\n\r\n3. From this list, the YrdC/Sua5 family (assigned to COG009) was the most probable candidate for an enzyme involved in t6A biosynthesis for the following reasons: (i) all organisms sequenced to date have a homolog of the YrdC/Sua5 proteins, some organisms, such as E. coli, have two representatives (YrdC and YciO), but most have only one; (ii) the YrdC domain is also found in the enzyme family HypF [involved in the maturation of the metal center of the Ni-Fe hydrogenase HypE] which catalyzes chemistries similar to the ones expected in t6A biosynthesis (Elkin et al., 1974); (iii) YrdC and YciO of E. coli were found to bind double-stranded RNA and tRNA (Teplova et al., 2000); (iv) Sua5 in yeast was proposed to be involved in translation (Na et al., 1992).\r\n\r\n3. We performed LC�MS/MS analysis of yeast tRNA extracted from different yeast strains, which linked the disappearance of the t6A peak to the deletion of sua5 (El Yacoubi, et al., 2009).\r\n\r\n4.  Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that the E. coli YrdC protein binds ATP and preferentially binds RNA(Thr) lacking only the t6A modification (El Yacoubi, et al., 2009).\r\n\r\n5.  We also investigated the essentiality of this gene family in two biological systems, E. coli and yeast and proved that yrdC is essential in E. coli, whereas SUA5 is dispensable in yeast but results in severe growth phenotypes (El Yacoubi, et al., 2009).\r\n\r\n6. However, specific biochemical function for the YrdC/Sua5 proteins (i.e. catalytic activity) aside from tRNA and ATP binding (El Yacoubi, et al., 2009) and ATPase activity (Agari et al., 2008), has not been determined.  Were unable to show threonine binding by YrdC, under ATP binding conditions, nor incorporation of threonine in a tRNAThr transcript in the presence of YrdC.  Further experimentation is needed to determine the role of YrdC in t6A biosynthesis.\r\n\r\n7. Although iso-functional, the YrdC and Sua5 subfamilies are distinguished in this database based their domain structure:  while both subfamilies contain the YrdC domain, only the Sua5 proteins carry an additional C-terminal Sua5 domain\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nPlant-Prokaryote project SUMMARY for YgjD/Kae1 family (At2g45270, At4g22720 in Arabidopsis):\r\n\r\nBased on a comparative genomic and structural analysis we predicted this family was involved in the biosynthesis of N6-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine, a universal modification found at position 37 of tRNAs decoding ANN codons (El Yacoubi et al., submitted). This was confirmed as a yeast mutant lacking Kae1 is devoid of t6A. The t6A-deletant strains were also used to reveal that t6A has a critical role in initiation codon restriction to AUG and in restricting frameshifiting at tandem ANN codons (El Yacoubi et al., submitted).\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS/BACKGROUND:\r\n\r\nThe YgjD/Kae1 family (COG0533) has been on the top-ten list of universally conserved proteins of unknown function for over five years (Galperin & Koonin, 2004). It is essential in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and several other bacteria where examined (Arigoni et al., 1998; Zalacain et al., 2003). It has been linked to DNA maintenance in bacteria and mitochondria and transcription regulation and telomere homeostasis in eukaryotes (Downey et al., 2006; Kisseleva-Romanova et al., 2006), but its actual function has never been found (Hecker et al., 2009).  Early work on the Pasteurella haemolytica homolog has erroneously assigned this family the function of O-sialoglycoprotein peptidase (Abdullah et al., 1991; Abdullah et al., 1992). Furthermore, it became the founding member of the M22 class of proteases, aggravating this mistake.  No other member of the protein family has this activity demonstrated, and even the Pasteurella protein expressed in E. coli lacks the activity.\r\nIn Archaea the YgjD proteins are often fused with p53-regulating protein kinase [PRPK (human) // YGR262c (yeast)].  The human protein is able to partially suppress the effects of a yeast mutation (the phenotype of which is abnormal budding).  The yeast protein is able to phosphorylate human p53.  For this reason the PRPK // YGR262c family is included in this SS\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nPlant-Prokaryote project SUMMARY for YaeZ family (no eukaryotic homologs):\r\n\r\nWe also showed that YaeZ, a YgjD paralog (Nichols et al., 2006), is required for YgjD function in vivo in bacteria.  Indeed the Bacillus subtilis ortholog of ygjD gene, ydiE, cannot complement the essentiality of the Escherichia coli ygjD gene in the absence of the B. subtilis yeaZ ortholog ydiC (El Yacoubi B. et al., submitted) \r\n\r\nSimilar to the YgjD family, YaeZ orthologs are also nearly universal among Bacteria, but missing from Eukarya and Archaea.  YeaZ is essential in Escherichia coli K12 (Handford et al., 2009).  Conditional expression strains for YaeZ, YgjD, and YjeE genes in EC show dramatic changes in cell ultrastructure (Handford et al., 2009).  Repression of the expression of yeaZ results in cells with highly condensed nucleoids, while repression of yjeE and ygjD expression results in at least a proportion of very enlarged cells with an unusual peripheral distribution of DNA.  The results of bacterial two-hybrid experiments show that YeaZ can interact with both YjeE and YgjD but that YgjD is the preferred interaction partner. The results of in vitro experiments indicate that YeaZ mediates the proteolysis of YgjD, suggesting that YeaZ and YjeE act as regulators to control the activity of this protein.  Our results are consistent with these proteins forming a link between DNA metabolism and cell division (Handford et al., 2009)\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1.

MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY OBSOLETE OR SIMPLY CAPTURES THE PROCESS OF SUBSYSTEM ENCODING ETC.

QSYN in some\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\n- very interesting: in all Streptococcus pneumoniae and pyogenes there is a stand-alone QAPRT in transposase environment. Evolution (horizontal transfer) in making! No other context, but it can probably salvage human quinolinate. Would be especially cool if they would correlate with some known syndromes where quinolinate is elevated.\r\n- in Shewanella, strangely QAPRT is missing (more cases)\r\n- Interesting comparison of Wolinella vs Campylo 1 vs 9 in de novo.\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\nNOTES FROM OLD \"NAD and NADP cofactor biosynthesis\" \r\nObservations and comments:\r\n0. The first step is driven by ASPOX in most bacteria. T,maritima and several anaerobic archaea have an alternative enzyme: ASPDH\r\n1. H.pylori and several other genomes have a missing gene problem in the first step of de novo biosynthesis from Aspartate. The only reasonable guess is a broadening of succinate dehydorgenase specificity?\r\n2. The source of amide (Gln or Asn?) and a gene encoding \"GAT\" function for those genomes that have a single-domain NADS is an open question.\r\n3. NAMNAT comes in two flavors: \r\n- NadD-tike as in most bacteria with a higher oreference for NaMN over NMN as a substrte (from ~10x in H.pylori to ~ 15,000x as in S.aureus, see Gerdes et al., J.Bacteriology,2002). \r\n- In most eukaryotes, it is bi-functional PNAT with comparable preference to both NMN and NaMN. These  two forms are only very distantly related by sequence, although share many elements of 3D structure. Typical Rossman fold/\"HIGH\" motif adenylyltransferase.\r\n4. NMNAT comes in 3+ flavors:\r\n- typical archaeal form (nadM-like). Strict preference for NMN\r\n- version of it in some bacteria (such as Synechocystis) is fused with Nudix hydrolase domain (ADPR)\r\n- eukaryotoc PNAT (see above)\r\n- NadR-like. Always fused with RNK domain. This bi-fucntional protein is the only NAD biosynthetic route in most pasteurellaceae. In enterics NadR has a third, N-terminal HTH-domain (transcription regulator of de novo biosynthesis.\r\n5. NRK comes in two flavors: bacterial (as in multifunctional NadR proteins) and eukaryotic, as recently found in H.sapiens and yeast.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnotation of KFA based on mouse experimental evidence\r\nTDO and IDO redundant\r\n\r\n========\r\nRecent comments:\r\nSoluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1) added, but no real seriosu analysis done (geneudhA in E.coli) a clear issue ius resolving with lipoamide dehydrogenase (does it even make sense?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"]},

        "description":"The majority of iron in human body is found intracellularly bound to hemoproteins, while transferrin comprises only 6�7.5% of the body�s iron pool accessible to bacteria.  Circulating erythrocytes are the primary iron-containing cells in the body, with between 60% and 75% of the body�s iron content being bound to hemoglobin. The oxygen storage protein, myoglobin, accounts for an additional 8�10%.  Other hemoproteins, along with iron-containing proteins such as iron sulfur proteins, make up a further 4�5% of iron in the  human body (Skaar, Schneewind, 2004 and refs therein). \r\n\r\nHemoprotein utilization is best understood in Gram-Negative bacteria (see Subsystem: \"Hemin transport system\"). Most of these organisms use TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors that directly bind to hemoproteins, extract, and transport the heme or the iron through the receptor cavity. A few bacteria produce hemophores that remove the heme and convey it to surface receptors and/or surface or secreted proteases that can release heme from hemoglobin.  Heme or iron crosses the cytoplasmic membrane by binding protein-dependent transport systems (PBT). The proteins of heme-PBT systems share homology and sequence signatures with transporters of siderophores and vitamin B12 (Bates et al., 2003).\r\n\r\nIn Gram-Positive bacteria proteins and genes involved in heme or hemoglobin utilization are only beginning to be understood and are currently under intense investigation, especially in Staphylococci, which preferentially acquire heme-iron over other physiologically relevant iron sources (Skaar et al. 2004b).  The molecular machinery responsible for staphylococcal heme acquisition is encoded by two distinct systems, the iron-regulated surface determinant system (Isd), and the heme transport system (Hts) (Mazmanian et al. 2003; Skaar et al. 2004b).  The Isd heme import machinery is comprised of 10 genes (Fur-regulated), encoding 4 cell wall anchored proteins (IsdABCH), a transpeptidase (SrtB), a membrane transport system (IsdDEF), and two cytoplasmic monooxygenases (IsdGI) (reviewed in Reniere et al., 2007).  Heme in S. aureus can also transit into the cytoplasm through the ABC-type transport system HtsABC, which is the more dominant heme transport system in vitro, than IsdDEF (Skaar et al. 2004b).  The Hts system exhibits strong identity to permease components of the HmuTUV heme transport system of Yersinia sp., Corynebacterium sp. (Drazek et al., 2000) and other species. \r\n\r\nHemolytic S. pyogenes could use the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex, hemoglobin, myoglobin, heme-albumin, and catalase, but not transferrin or lactoferrin as iron source in the human body.   ABC-type transporter SiaABC located within a highly conserved, iron regulated, 10-gene operon contributes to heme uptake in this organism (Bates et al., 2002).  The operon�s first gene named Shr (for streptococcal hemoprotein receptor) encodes a novel bacterial protein that bound hemoglobin, myoglobin, heme-albumin, and hemoglobin-haptoglobin (but not apo-haptoglobin).  In addition to SiaABC, two other pneumococcal operons piu and pia (formerly pit1 and pit2), encoding homologous ABC transporters, were identified (Brown et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2002).  The piu and pia transporters are required for the transport of inorganic iron, as well as for iron capture from hemoglobin.  Significant defects in hemoglobin utilization were observed only when both loci where inactivated (Bates et al., 2003).   Their homologs in other organisms may or may NOT utilize heme (and have been included in this SS as merely Auxiliary roles) \r\n \r\nThree potential fates of host-derived heme have been suggested in S. aureus: (i) degradation for use as a nutrient iron source, (ii) incorporation into bacterial heme-binding proteins for use as an enzyme cofactor, or (iii) eflux through a dedicated transport system HrtAB (Reniere et al., 2007).  When intracellular Fe concentration is low, iron can be obtain through enzymatic degradation of acquired heme.  Three families of Heme oxygenases have been described: HmuO-like family (prototype in C. diphtheria (Schmitt 1997b)), the ChuS-family (E. coli (Suits et al., 2005)), and the IsdG-family of monooxygenases (first described in S. aureus (Skaar et al., 2005a)). Mechanism dealing with toxicity of acquired heme are not yet understood, however HrtAB transporter has been identified as putative heme efflux pump (Reniere et al., 2007)\r\n",

        "description":"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized posttranslationally modified natural products found in bacteria.  Their defining structural feature is a macrolactam ring that is threaded by the C-terminal tail and held in position by sterically demanding residues above and below the ring, resulting in a unique topology that is reminiscent of a lariat knot (open Illustrations tab above to view Fig.1 from PMID:22949633).  The biosynthesis of lasso peptides is directed by a cluster of three genes (McjABC), encoding a precursor peptide A, a cysteine protease B, and an ATP-dependent lactam synthetase C. Gene clusters might contain additional genes, e.g. efflux pump, regulators, etc (PMID: 26079760)\n\nCurrently known lasso peptides seem to possess a wide variety of biological activities. In some case antimicrobial activity was detected, and specific molecular targets were identified (reviewed in PMID: 26079760), including Gram-negative RNA polymerase (RNAP) for MccJ25 and capistruin (PMID: 21396375), or hsp100 family chaperone ClpC1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis for lassomycin (PMID: 24684906). However, the majority of recently isolated lasso peptides do not exhibit any observable inhibitory capacities, and their native function are still unknown\n\nThese remarkable molecules are a focus of intense research, because a number of lasso peptides demonstrated pharmacologically relevant activities, including inhibition of bacterial growth, receptor antagonism, and enzyme inhibition (PMID: 22949633). However, their true native function and the exact enzymatic mechanism of their maturation still remain elusive (PMID: 26079760)   \n\n\n\n",

        "description":"The compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is made by many marine phytoplankton, including dinoflagellates, diatoms, and coccolithophores, several marine macroalgal seaweeds and a few land plants.  This zwitterion probably acts as an osmolyte, although other anti-stress functions have been suggested.  Its high concentrations in the producing organisms (~0.5 M in some cases) coupled to their wide distributions in the oceans, means that DMSP is one of the most abundant (109 tons made per annum) organic, sulfur-containing molecules on Earth [reviewed in refs !, 2, 3] \r\nFurthermore, in the oceans it is a major source of carbon and sulphur for marine bacteria that break it down to products such as dimethyl sulphide (DMS), which are important in their own right and have wide-ranging effects, from altering animal behaviour to seeding cloud formation (PMID: 21986900).  DMS-derived sulfur influences global temperature and Earth�s homeostasis through effects on cloud cover, mediated through aerosols derived from its oxidation (Charlson et al. 1987).\r\n\r\nThe catabolic fate of DMSP in different bacteria is complex and varied [see scheme under the Illustrations tab above].  The two main pathways of bacterial degradation, routing DMSP to distinctly different biogeochemical fates, have recently been identified: \r\n(1)\tdemethylation of DMSP to methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA), which is then further catabolized to methane thiol and acetate, mediated by the genes dmdA, dmdB, dmdC, and dmdD.  This route accounts for most of the global DMSP catabolic flux.  It facilitate retention of carbon and sulfur in the marine microbial food web and does not liberate any dimethylsulfide;\r\n(2a)\tcleavage of DMSP to dimethyl sulphide (DMS) plus acrylate (can be catalyzed by no less than 5 (!) distinct DMSP lyases:  dddL, dddP, dddQ, dddW, and dddY) \r\n(2b)\tcleavage of DMSP to DMS plus 3-hydrohypropionate (catalyzed by DddD)\r\n\r\nThese pathways and the combinations thereof are flagged by variant codes 1, 2, 3, 4 in this SS spreadsheet.

It strongly clusters with other DMSP catabolic genes in marine bacteria.  Surprisingly, very close homologs were detected in E. coli (YhdH, b3253, acuI) and many other bacteria, which do not encounter acrylate or DMSP in their natural environment (variant code 9).  The authors hypothesize �that primary role of AcuI is to act as a cleansing agent for Acryloyl-CoA\" (PMID:22563425).  Indeed, yhdH deletion makes E.coli very sensitive to acrylate (500-fold) and 3-hydroxypropionate (20-fold).

        "description":"Arsenic is one of the most prevalent toxic metal/metalloids in the world, present in soils and environments containing arsenic-based minerals (arsenopyrite, realgar, orpiment, etc.). For more than 20 years, it has ranked first on the priority list of hazardous substances from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/spl/), based on its environmental ubiquity, toxicity, and potential hazards for humans (PMID: 28438267). Soil and saprophytic microorganisms have developed molecular detoxification mechanisms to survive arsenic-rich environments, mainly by the enzymatic conversion of inorganic arsenate (AsV) to arsenite (AsIII) by arsenate reductases, which is then extruded by arsenite permeases (PMID: 28438267)\r\n\r\nArsenate reductases (ArsCs) are unusual among well studied enzyme classes, because there is not a single family of evolutionarily related sequences.  The structural folds and mechanisms they are using are fundamentally different and arose independently during evolution (PMID: 12426124). As a group Arsenate reductases are small cytoplasmic redox enzymes that reduce arsenate to arsenite (As(III)) by the sequential involvement of three different thiolate nucleophiles that function as a redox cascade. As such, arsenate reductases in different organisms  work together with the specific thiol/disulfide mechanism available in the cell (PMID:19286650). Thus, different classes of ArsCs are coupled to thioredoxin system [composed of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase] (PMID:  8003493), OR glutathione system [composed GSH with glutaredoxin and glutathione reductase] (PMID: 12426124), OR to mycothiol and mycoredoxin (PMID: 19286650). Furthermore, different structural folds are found within some of these cases (e.g. PMID:11573087), compounding the complexity of this group of enzymes.\r\n\r\nAsIII is much more toxic than AsV. However, the reduction of AsV in the detoxification mechanism is evolutionarily explained by the absence of phosphate-releasing pumps and the presence of AsIII efflux pumps that work in concert with ArsCs (Villadangos et al., 2012)\r\n\r\n\n",

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) deamidase (EC 3.5.1.42), one of the key enzymes of the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle, was originally described in Enterobacteria, but the corresponding gene eluded identification for over 30 years. A genomics-based reconstruction of NAD metabolism across hundreds of bacterial species suggested that NMN deamidase reaction is the only possible way of nicotinamide salvage in the marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. This prediction was verified via purification of native NMN deamidase from S. oneidensis followed by the identification of the respective gene, termed pncC. Enzymatic characterization of the PncC protein, as well as phenotype analysis of deletion mutants, confirmed its proposed biochemical and physiological function in S. oneidensis. Of the three PncC homologs present in Escherichia coli, NMN deamidase activity was confirmed only for the recombinant purified product of the ygaD gene. A comparative analysis at the level of sequence and three-dimensional structure, which is available for one of the PncC family member, shows no homology with any previously described amidohydrolases. Multiple alignment analysis of functional and nonfunctional PncC homologs, together with NMN docking experiments, allowed us to tentatively identify the active site area and conserved residues therein. An observed broad phylogenomic distribution of predicted functional PncCs in the bacterial kingdom is consistent with a possible role in detoxification of NMN, resulting from NAD utilization by DNA ligase.

        "description":"A collection of large virulence exoproteins, including Ca21-independent cytolysins, an iron acquisition protein and several adhesins, are secreted by the two-partner secretion (TPS) pathway in various Gram- negative bacteria. The hallmarks of the TPS pathway are the presence of an N-proximal module called the `secretion domain' in the exoproteins that we have named the TpsA family, and the channel-forming beta-barrel transporter proteins we refer to as the TpsB family. The genes for cognate exoprotein and transporter protein are usually organized in an operon. Specific secretion signals are present in a highly conserved region of the secretion domain of TpsAs. TpsBs probably serve as specific receptors of the TpsA secretion signals and as channels for the translocation of the exoproteins across the outer membrane.  A subfamily of transporters also mediates activation of their cognate cytolysins upon secretion. The exoproteins are synthesized as precursors with an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide, and a subset of them carries an extended signal peptide of unknown function. According to our current model, the exoproteins are probably translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane in a Sec-dependent fashion, and their signal peptide is probably processed by a LepB-type signal peptidase. The N-proximal secretion domain directs the exoproteins towards their transporters early, so that translocation across both membranes is coupled. The exoproteins transit through the periplasm in an extended conformation and fold progressively at the cell surface before eventually being released into the extracellular milieu. Several adhesins also undergo extensive proteolytic processing upon secretion. The genes of many new TpsAs and TpsBs are found in recently sequenced genomes, suggesting that the TPS pathway is widespread (quoted from (Jacob-Dubuisson et al., 2001))\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.

Structure elucidation of colorless linear tetrapyrroles as (final) breakdown products of chlorophyll was crucial for the recent delineation of a chlorophyll breakdown pathway which is highly conserved in land plants. Pheophorbide a oxygenase is the key enzyme responsible for opening of the chlorin macrocycle of pheophorbide a characteristic to all further breakdown products. Degradation of chlorophyll was rationalized by the need of a senescing cell to detoxify the potentially phototoxic pigment, yet recent investigations in leaves and fruits indicate that chlorophyll catabolites could have physiological roles. This review updates structural information of chlorophyll catabolites and the biochemical reactions involved in their formation, and discusses the significance of chlorophyll breakdown.

        "description":"Colicins are a group of protein antibiotics that have various modes of action. They are usually encoded on plasmids, often with genes encoding colicin immunity factors, protecting colicin-producing cells from their own colicin. Of the enzymatic (E) colicins, some carry nuclease activity, including colicin E2, colicin E9, and colicin E3. These three proteins bind to susceptible cells via the surface protein BtuB (the vitamin B12 importer) and, through a series of events that are poorly understood, cross the cell envelope to enter the cytoplasm, where they degrade nucleic acids: colicins E2 and E9 target DNA; colicin E3 targets rRNA (PMID:17347522)\n\nTolerance to colicin E2 (Cet2 phenotype) was originally believed to be due to overexpression of CreD protein (an inner membrane protein of unknown function (PMID: 2835585)) upont its induction by CreBC signal transduction system. However, it was later demonstrated (PMID:20418396) that although overproduction of CreD in a Cet2 strain indeed results from hyperactivation of the CreBC two-component regulator, CreD overproduction is NOT responsible for the Cet2 phenotype. Instead, overexpression of another CreBC-regulated gene, yieJ (also known as cbrC), causes the Cet2 phenotype.  Both protein families, CreD and CbrC are encoded in this Subsystem (for historic reasons), along with the CreBC signal transduction two-component system, which regulates both of them.  \n\nCreC was originally designated PhoM, because it can act as a phosphate donor for PhoB, a response regulator that controls expression of the pho regulon (PMID: 7021308). CreB is a target for phospho-relay from phospho-CreC and is the cognate CreC response regulator. CreBC is activated on minimal medium when E.coli is fermenting glycolytic carbon sources and during aerobic growth on gluconeogenic carbon (PMID:11350954; PMID: 18375564). \n\nThe CreBC genes are cotranscribed with the conserved gene of unknown function creA in some Enterobacteriaceae.  Orthologs of CreA are present in a large number of Proteobacteria, including organisms that do not encode CreBC or CreD.  The function of this family is still unknown.  In E.coli  CreB and CreC are essential for the activation of cre regulon genes, but CreA and CreD (encoded as part of the creABCD gene cluster) are not (PMID: 18375564)\n\n",

        "description":" Major terpenoid building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), are produced via two different biosynthetic routes: in some species by the so-called mevalonate pathway, and in others by the non-mevalonate or DOXP pathway. Both pathways produce the same key building blocks (IPP and DMAPP), essential in all forms of cellular life. They have apparently involved completely independently, and they share only one enzyme � Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IPDDI). Historically the mevalonate pathway and its enzymes were thoroughly studied in eukaryotes. Some bacteria also use mevalonate pathway, and all of the corresponding genes were identified based on homology with eukaryotic counterparts [Ref.2,3].  Although usually bacteria have only one of the two pathways, there are exceptions: Listeria has boths. Plants also have both, but one of them (DOXP) is of plastid (bacterial) origin. All other eukaryotes and archaea appear to have only mevalonate pathway. ISPC seems to be a missing gene in Brucella ssp. Reconstruction of the mevalonate pathway in archaea including conjectures for some locally missing genes was described [Ref.4]. The alternative DOXP pathway, characteristic of most bacteria was not recognized until very recently (for a review see [Ref.5]), and some aspects of it remained obscure until recently [Ref.6,7]. \n",

Recent kinetic, spectroscopic and crystallographic studies have shown that the enzyme activates its substrates, MI and O(2), at a carboxylate-bridged nonheme diiron(ii/iii) cluster, making it the first of many known nonheme diiron oxygenases to employ the mixed-valent form of its cofactor. Evidence suggests that: (1) the Fe(iii) site coordinates MI via its C1 and C6 hydroxyl groups; (2) the Fe(ii) site reversibly coordinates O(2) to produce a superoxo-diiron(iii/iii) intermediate; and (3) the pendant oxygen atom of the superoxide ligand abstracts hydrogen from C1 to initiate the unique C-C-bond-cleaving, four-electron oxidation reaction.\nBollinger JM Jr, Diao Y, Matthews ML, Xing G, Krebs C., Dalton Trans. 2009 Feb 14;(6):905-14.

        "description":"The PnuC family is one more example of a transporter family with high variability of specificities predicted by the comparative genomic analysis (Fig. 4). The only two experimentally characterized representatives of this family are the nicotinamide riboside permeases PnuC that are involved in the utilization of this metabolic precursor of NAD in Haemophilus influenzae (Sauer et al., 2004) and Salmonella enterica (Grose et al., 2005). In the enterobacteria, the pnuC gene is located in one operon with the NAD biosynthesis gene nadA, and this operon is regulated by the NAD repressor NadR [61]. Analysis of other NAD-related regulons revealed several pnuC-like genes preceded by candidate binding sites of transcription factors YrxA in the Streptococcus spp., NrtR in Hahella chejuensis, and PnuR in the Vibrio spp. [189,190]. In addition, positional clustering of various pnuC-like genes with genes involved in NAD salvage was observed, e.g. in the Pseudomonas spp. This allows for projecting the nicotinamide riboside permease function to these genes (shown in orange in Fig. 4). \r\nThough it was assumed that homologs of PnuC in general represent nicotinamide riboside-specific transporters [67,219], other studies suggest a different functional role for other members of the PnuC family. A large group of pnuC-like transporters (called pnuT) was found in thiamin regulons under control of the THI riboswitch in the Proteobacteria and the Bacteroidetes species (shown in blue in Fig. 4). These pnuT genes were located in conserved gene clusters also encoding outer membrane TonB-dependent transporters (OMPs) and predicted kinases from various families (e.g. a homolog of the thiamin pyrophosphokinase TNR3 from yeast). Based on these data, it was proposed that these hypothetical THI-regulated operons could be involved in the thiamin uptake across the outer and inner membranes (by OMP and PnuT, respectively) and its subsequent phosphorylation to form thiamin pyrophosphate coenzyme [193]. The predicted thiamin transporters PnuT are distributed among several different branches on the phylogenetic tree of the PnuC family (Fig. 4). Interestingly, one branch contains both candidate transporters PnuT and PnuC suggesting that specificity of transporters in this family is flexible in evolution. \r\nOne more branch on the PnuC family tree contains the predicted riboflavin transporters PnuX. This tentative annotation was based on the observation of pnuX genes preceded by RFN regulatory elements in the Actinobacteria [247] (shown in magenta in Fig. 4). In three Actinobacteria species, the pnuX genes are located in the riboflavin biosynthesis rib operons (Supplemenatry Figure 1), providing additional evidence for the predicted functional role of PnuX. Recently, the function of PnuX from Corynebacterium glutamicum was studied in experiment: as predicted, the transport by PnuX (re-named RibM) was not energy-dependent and had high affinity for riboflavin [248]. \r\nFinally, a group of PnuC-like transporters in the Lactobacillus spp. (called PnuN) is co-regulated by the NrdR repressor with ribonuclotide reductases (Nrd) and a deoxynucleoside kinase (Dgk) that are involved in the dNTP synthesis [198] (shown in green in Fig. 4).  The pnuN and dgk genes in Enterococcus faecalis form a candidate NrdR-controlled operon. This yields tentative reconstruction of the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway, which involves transport and subsequent phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides. \r\nOverall the PnuC-like transporters are involved in the uptake of unphosphorylated metabolites (nicotinamide riboside, thiamin, riboflavin, and deoxynucleosides) that are then phosphorylated in the cytoplasm by respective kinases, thus allowing to direct the substrate flow inside and to prevent efflux (Supplementary Figure 2). Indeed, in H.influenzae, the PnuC-mediated substrate flow across the membrane is coupled to the rate of nicotinamide riboside phosphorylation [134].\r\nEven with these examples, some might argue that the genomic analysis provides only a limited extension of existing knowledge: characterization of new specificity in an existing family or, at best, description of a new family. Our last example demonstrates that sometimes it is possible to predict new transport mechanisms using only genomic analysis.\r\n\r\nPlease see the following review paper for the figures, details and references:\r\nGelfand MS, Rodionov DA.

Hydrolysis of the antibiotic is a path chemically similar to its action on a muropeptide and would quickly destroy the four-membered strained ring compound and could occur at high rate.\r\nBecause this is similar to the transpeptidase action needed for sacculus expansion, with just a few changes, a functional PBP for growth could have been duplicated and one copy turned from a transpeptidase into a D,D- hydrolase (&#946;-lactamase). Considering how easy this is theoretically, one is not surprised that this has happened many times and in many ways and in many lines of descent.\r\n\r\n...The available amino acid sequences provide evidence that make it is clear that the lactamases came from a PBP and did not arise independently...  The amino acid sequences of the genes for this large family of penicillin-recognizing enzymes: the PBPs per se, penicillin-sensing proteins, and &#946;-lactamases have several highly conserved sequences of amino acid (Figure 5).  It is clear that all the proteins together form a super family.\"\r\n\r\n",

Biofilm formation is an important aspect of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and corneal and medical device infections related to S. aureus.  It is a muti-step process (for a review see Fitzpatrick et al., 2005; Mack et al., 2004; Gotz, 2002) with the two major stages:\r\n  (i) adherence of cells to a surface (encoded in SS: Adhesins in Staphylococcus) and \r\n  (ii) growth-dependent multilayered cell cluster accumulation mediated by intercellular adhesion (which is a focus of this SS).\r\n\r\nThe key role in the latter process is played by PNAG, partially N-acetylated linear beta-1�6-linked glucosaminoglycan, also known as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA).  It�s biosynthesis is catalyzed by the products of the icaABCD operon (ICA = intercellular adhesion (Heilmann et al., 1996)).  The icaR gene is transcribed divergently from the icaABCD genes and encodes a regulatory protein that binds to the ica promoter just upstream of the initiation codon for the IcaA protein.  PNAG (PIA) is also involved in haemagglutination and acts as an  intercellular adhesin on glass and (probably) other hydrophilic surfaces (McKenney D et al.,1998; Crampton, et al.,1999; Kropec etal.,2005)\r\n\r\nNumerous conditions and exogenous factors influence ica transcription and PNAG synthesis, but the regulatory factors relaying these stimuli have been only partially characterized (Jefferson et al., 2004),  regulators identified so far are included in this SS.  Regulation of ica operon and biofilm development:\r\n(i)  negatively controlled by ica operon regulator IcaR (strong repressor) and \r\n(ii) teicoplasmin-associated locus regulator TcaR (weak repressor) (Jefferson et al., 2004).\r\n(iii)  SarA is an essential positive regulator of biofilm development in Staphylococcus epidermidis (ref) and S. aureus (Tormo et al., 2005).  \r\n(iv)  in S. epidermidis the alternative sigma factor B  positively influences ica operon expression by negatively regulating icaR expression.  However, mutations in the S. aureus sigB locus do not result in a biofilm-negative phenotype, thus highlighting an important difference in biofilm development between these species (Fitzpatrick et al., 2005).  \r\n(v)  Disruption of Arg (accessory gene regulator) system, the only known quorum-sensing system in staphylococci (not included here, see SS: Accessory_Gene_Regulator), leads to increased biofilm development, hence Arg activation may contribute to biofilm detachment and metastatic spread to secondary infection sites (Firzpatrick et al., 2005) \r\n\r\nIn addition to PIA, another carbohydrate-containing polymer, extracellular teichoic acid (EC TA), has recently been clearly identified as the second major essential component of S. epidermidis RP62A biofilms (Sadovskaya et al., 2005).  The poly(glycerol phosphate) EC TA is a highly polar and hydrophilic molecule, while PIA is rich in relatively hydrophobic N-acetyl groups. Various relative amounts of extracellular PIA and EC TA are produced depend on the growth conditions.  This capacity to regulate positive and negative charges, as well as hydrophilic properties of its biofilm constituents might increase the ability of S. epidermidis RP62A to form biofilms on surfaces with different physicochemical properties under various environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of biofilm-negative mutants, in which PIA production was unaffected lead to identification of additional factors involved in biofilm formation in S. epidermidis and S. aureus:\r\n(i)  Accumulation-associated protein AAP (Hussain, et al., 1997).  To gain adhesive function, full-length AAP has to be proteolytically processed through staphylococcal or host proteases.  It is therefore possible that in vivo effector mechanisms of the innate immunity can directly induce protein-dependent S. epidermidis cell aggregation and biofilm formation (Rohde et al., 2005).\r\n(ii) Antiadhesin Pls, binding to squamous nasal epithelial cells.  Pls could at one point of an infection prevent adhesion, allowing cells to spread, and at another point help staphylococci to adhere to tissues and structures of the host.  Pls is cleaved as a result of the activation of receptor-bound plasminogen on the MRSA surface in vitro. The cleavage of Pls might reveal its as-yet-unknown, possibly adhesive properties (Savolainen et al., 2001), e.g. similar to a proteolytic activation mechanism of AAP (Rohde et al., 2005).  \r\n(iii)  The major autolysin AtlE � bifunctional: N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28)/ endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.96)\r\n(iv)  Staphylococcal surface protein SSP1 (not included in SS: no sequence has been associated with it yet (Veenstra et al., 1996))\r\n(v)  Biofilm-associated protein Bap - a novel cell wall-anchored,  2276-amino-acid protein found in 5% of the S. aureus bovine mastitis isolates, but absent in the 75 clinical human S. aureus isolates analyzed (Cucarella et al., 2001).

        "notes":["Biotin biosynthesis.\r\n\r\nBiotin (vitamin H) is an essential cofactor for a class of important metabolic enzymes, biotin carboxylases and decarboxylases (Perkins and Pero 2001). Biotin biosynthetic pathway is widespread among microorganisms. The well-studied systems of biotin biosynthesis from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtils, and Bacillus sphaericus differ in the first step of biosynthesis. B. subtils and B. sphaericus use pimeloyl-CoA synthase encoded by the bioW gene to synthesize pimeloyl-CoA from pimelic acid. In E. coli, pimeloyl-CoA is synthesized from L-alanine and/or acetate via acetyl-CoA, instead of pimelic acid (Ifuku et al. 1994), and products of the bioC and bioH genes are required for the pimeloyl-CoA synthesis in E. coli (EC numbers do not assigned). The pathway from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin is similar in E. coli and bacilli and uses products of the bioF, bioD, bioA, and bioB genes. Genes encoding biotin transporters have not been identified in bacteria until recently.\r\nThe biotin operon of E. coli is negatively regulated by biotin and the bifunctional protein BirA (DeMoll 1994). The biotin-protein ligase BirA mediates biotinylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase via a two-step reaction. Firstly, the adenylate of biotin is synthesized from substrates biotin and ATP and, at the second step, transferred to a unique lysine residue on carboxylase. When biotin is unclaimed, two generated BirA-biotinyl-5`-AMP monomers bind cooperatively to the bioO operator between the divergent bioA and bioBCDF operons and repress transcription in both directions. The BirA protein is composed of the N-terminal DNA-binding (D-b) domain containing a helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure, the central domain, and the C-terminal domain. The central catalytic domain contains the binding site for biotinyl-5`-AMP and also is required for transcriptional regulation (Kwon et al. 2000).\r\nUsing comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis, the biotin biosynthetic pathway and the BirA regulon has been described in most available bacterial genomes (Rodionov et al., 2002). Based on analysis of co-occurrence of the biotin biosynthetic genes and bioY in complete genomes, as well as on the distribution of the BirA bining sites, it has been predicted that the transmembrane protein BioY is involved in biotin transport. Different non-orthologous substitutes of the bioC-coupled gene bioH from E. coli (named bioG, bioZ and bioK), observed in several genomes, possibly represent existence of different pathways for the pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis. \r\n\r\n#1,2\tbirA: Biotin-protein ligase (EC 6.3.4.15) and Biotin operon repressor are encoded by the bifunctional protein BirA in E. coli and many other bacteria. The biotin-protein ligase domain is ubiquitous to almost all prokaryodes. In contrast, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain containing a helix-turn-helix structure (Biotin operon repressor domain) is not so widely distributed, showing that BirA-mediated regulation of transcription for the biotin synthesis genes is more-or-less facultative. The predicted BirA-binding sites are well-conserved among various eubacterial and archaeal genomes. Existence of N-terminal DNA-binding domain in BirA strictly correlates with presence of putative BirA-binding sites upstream of biotin operons (Rodionov et al., 2000, Genome Res. 12:1507).\r\n\r\n#3,4,5,6 are widely-distributed genes required for the de novo biotin synthesis from pimeloyl-CoA precursor and form the most conserved part of the pathway. Among the genomes encoding the biotin biosynthetic pathway these genes are missing only in minimal number of species:\r\n#3 (bioF): in Clostridia species, Aquifex, and two Corynebacteria species;\r\n#4 (bioA): several Clostridia species and cyanobacteria,  \r\n#5 (bioD): no missing\r\n#6 (bioB): no missing\r\n\r\n#7,8,9,10,11,12 constitute variants of the pimeloyl-CoA precursor synthesis. \r\n\r\n#7 (bioW): is functionally characterized in several Bacillus species where it is involved in direct synthesize of pimeloyl-CoA from pimelic acid.\r\n\r\n#8,9 (bioC, bioH): In E. coli, pimeloyl-CoA is synthesized from L-alanine and/or acetate via acetyl-CoA, instead of  pimelic acid (Ifuku et al. 1994), and products of the bioC and bioH genes are required for the pimeloyl-CoA synthesis in E. coli. Exact biochemical functions of these two genes were not clear until recently. However, a recent analysis of BioH with a panel of hydrolase assays revealed a carboxylesterase activity with a preference for short acyl chain substrates (Sanishvili et al., 2003, J.Biol.Chem. 278:26039). For BioC, it is possesses S-adenosylmethionine binding motif and belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily.\r\n\r\nThe bioC-bioH gene pair is required for the synthesis of pimeloyl-CoA in E. coli. The bioC gene is widely distributed in bacteria, whereas bioH was not found in many bioC-containing bacterial genomes. Instead, we predict several non-orthologous gene displacements of bioH in some of these genomes. \r\n\r\n#8,10 (bioC, bioG): A possible non-orthologous displacement of bioH by another gene, named bioG, was detected by bioinformatic analysis in some proteobacteria, the CFB group of bacteria, and Fusobacterium (Rodionov et al., 2000, Genome Res. 12:1507). The bioG gene always forms an operon with bioC and other biotin synthesis genes in these genomes; furthermore, in Bacteroides fragilis there is a single gene encoding a fused protein BioC-BioG. Most gamma-proteobacteria except Pasteurellaeceae possess the bioC-bioH gene pair, whereas all Pasteurellaeceae have bioC-bioG. Notably, Neisseria meningitidis has both bioC-bioH and bioC-bioG gene pairs, and the latter likely has been acquired from Haemophilus influenzae or a closely related bacterium, as the respective genes are highly similar. The phylogenetic tree of the BioC family has a separate branch for the proteins associated with BioG.\r\n\r\n#8,11 (bioC, bioK): Another bioC-linked gene, named bioK, was found in some cyanobacteria. The genomes of Synechococcus sp. and Prochlorococcus marinus contain the bioFKCDA operon and the bioB gene. Two other cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. and Nostoc sp., have all biotin biosynthetic genes except bioC and bioK. Therefore, they possibly use a different pathway for the pimeloyl-CoA synthesis.\r\n\r\n#8,12 (bioC, bioZ): Another bioC-linked gene, named bioZ, was found in rhizobia (alpha-proteobacteria), where it is the last gene in the biotin biosynthesis operon. It was recently shown that the bioZ gene from the bioABFDZ operon of Mesorhizobium loti can complement bioH of E. coli (Sullivan et al. 2001). \r\n\r\nThe observed diversity of enzymes for the first step of the biotin biosynthesis (pimeloyl-CoA synthesis) can reflect either frequent non-orthologous gene displacements, or possible use of different substrates for the biotin biosynthesis.\r\n\r\n#13 (bioY): Based on analysis of co-occurrence of the biotin biosynthetic genes and bioY in complete genomes, the hypothetical transmembrane protein BioY was predicted to be involved in biotin transport  (Rodionov et al., 2000, Genome Res. 12:1507). bioY is widely distributed in bacteria and often clusters with genes of biotin metabolism. The homologs of BioY form a unique protein family  (InterPro entry IPR003784), and have no significant similarity with any gene of known function. Analysis of the BirA regulatory sites showed that bioY is always under regulation of the biotin repressor in the genomes containing a regulatory domain of BirA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"]},

Bact, Mar 2004, p 1629-1637\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the abstract:\r\n\r\nThe Tricarballylate utilization (tcuRABC) genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2.\r\n\r\nLewis JA, Horswill AR, Schwem BE, Escalante-Semerena JC.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin--Madison, 53726-4087, USA.\r\n\r\nThe genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 encoding functions needed for the utilization of tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source were identified and their locations in the chromosome were established. Three of the tricarballylate utilization (tcu) genes, tcuABC, are organized as an operon; a fourth gene, tcuR, is located immediately 5' to the tcuABC operon. The tcuABC operon and tcuR gene share the same direction of transcription but are independently transcribed. The tcuRABC genes are missing in the Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome. The tcuR gene is proposed to encode a regulatory protein needed for the expression of tcuABC. The tcuC gene is proposed to encode an integral membrane protein whose role is to transport tricarballylate across the cell membrane. tcuC function was sufficient to allow E. coli K-12 to grow on citrate (a tricarballylate analog) but not to allow growth of this bacterium on tricarballylate. E. coli K-12 carrying a plasmid with wild-type alleles of tcuABC grew on tricarballylate, suggesting that the functions of the TcuABC proteins were the only ones unique to S. enterica needed to catabolize tricarballylate. Analyses of the predicted amino acid sequences of the TcuAB proteins suggest that TcuA is a flavoprotein, and TcuB is likely anchored to the cell membrane and probably contains one or more Fe-S centers. The TcuB protein is proposed to work in concert with TcuA to oxidize tricarballylate to cis-aconitate, which is further catabolized via the Krebs cycle. The glyoxylate shunt is not required for growth of S. enterica on tricarballylate. A model for tricarballylate catabolism in S. enterica is proposed.\r\n\r\n======  <<< Next Paper >>>   ====\r\n\r\nJournal of Bacteriology, August 2006, p. 5479-5486, Vol. 188, No. 15\r\n\r\nThe FAD-Dependent Tricarballylate Dehydrogenase (TcuA) Enzyme of Salmonella enterica Converts Tricarballylate into cis-Aconitate{dagger}\r\nJeffrey A. Lewis and Jorge C. Escalante-Semerena\r\n\r\nTricarballylate is the causative agent of grass tetany, a ruminant disease characterized by acute magnesium deficiency. Tricarballylate toxicity has been attributed to its ability to chelate magnesium and to inhibit aconitase, a Krebs cycle enzyme. Neither the ruminant nor the normal rumen flora can catabolize tricarballylate to ameliorate its toxic effects. However, the gram-negative enterobacterium Salmonella enterica can use tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source, providing an opportunity to study the genes and enzymes required for tricarballylate catabolism. The tricarballylate utilization (tcu) genes are organized into two transcriptional units, i.e., tcuR and tcuABC. Here, we report the initial biochemical analysis of TcuA. TcuA catalyzed the oxidation of tricarballylate to cis-aconitate. The apparent Km of TcuA for tricarballylate was 3.8 � 0.4 mM, with a Vmax of 7.9 � 0.3 mM min�1, turnover number (kcat) of 6.7 x 10�2 s�1, and a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 17.8 M�1 s�1. Optimal activity was measured at pH 7.5 and 30�C. The enzyme was inactivated at 45�C. One mole of FAD was present per mole of TcuA.

        "description":"The Acetyl-CoA Pathway is the major mechanism of CO2 and CO fixation under anaerobic conditions.It is characterized by the use of hydrogen as an electron donor and carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to produce acetyl-CoA as the final product. This two step process begins with the reduction of a carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide.\r\nThe carbon dioxide that is reduced to a carbonyl group, via the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, is combined with the methyl group to form acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA synthase complex is responsible for this reaction. \r\nIt couples the folate-mediated one-carbon (C1) metabolism to either CO2 reduction or acetate oxidation via acetyl-CoA.\r\nis used in both the oxidative and reductive directions. Besides being used for energy production and autotrophic carbon assimilation in acetogens (Ljungdahl, 1994; Ragsdale, 1997; Drake et al., 2002), the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is used for acetate catabolism by sulfate reducing bacteria (Schauder et al., 1988; Spormann and Thauer, 1988) and aceticlastic methanogens (Ferry, 1999) and for CO2 fixation by hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Stupperich et al., 1983; Ladapo and Whitman, 1990).\r\ntwo molecules of CO2 are reduced to a methyl and a carbonyl group, and are joined with coenzyme A (CoA) to make acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is then incorporated into cell carbon or converted to acetyl phosphate, whose phosphoryl group is transferred to ADP to generate ATP and acetate, the main growth product of acetogenic bacteria\r\n",

Lacking key enzymes for both C1 metabolism and CO2 reduction this organism cleaves acetyl-CoA to donate a methyl group for the production of methyl-tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) for methionine biosynthesis, representing an unconventional strategy for generating CH3-THF in organisms without methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase. Carbon monoxide (CO) was found to accumulate as an obligate by-product from the acetyl-CoA cleavage because of the lack of a CO dehydrogenase. CO accumulation inhibits the sustainable growth and dechlorination of strain 195 maintained in pure cultures, but can be prevented by CO-metabolizing anaerobes that coexist with D. mccartyi, resulting in an unusual syntrophic association.

        "description":"Poly-gamma-glutamate (PGA), a natural polymer, is synthesized by several bacteria, one archaea and one eukaryote.  It is currently viewed as a potential new biodegradable material in the fields of foods, cosmetics, and medicine.  For example, Natto, traditional Japanese fermented food made from soybeans by Bacillus subtilis (formerly Bacillus natto), contains abundant DL -PGA, which consists of 50 � 80%  D- and 20 � 50% L-glutamate as a main component. \r\n\r\nPoly-gamma-glutamate is an unusual anionic polypeptide, in which glutamate is polymerized via the gamma-amide linkages, and thus needs be synthesized in a ribosome-independent manner. \r\n\r\nPGA has diverse functions that vary according to the species synthesizing it and their environment.  Soil bacteria (mostly from the genus Bacillus, but excluding B. anthracis) use released PGA for the sequestration of toxic metal ions, increasing their resistance to adverse environments (McLean et al., 1990).  PGA may also be a source of glutamate for bacteria in a starvation state during late stationary phase (Kimura et al., 2004a).  Planococcus halophilus, Sporosarcina halophila and Natrialba asiatica, the only archaea known to produce PGA, use it to decrease high local salt  concentrations, enabling them to survive in a hostile environment (Kandler et al., 1983; Hezayen et al., 2001).  Finally,   Cnidaria , animals armed with stringing cells called nematocysts, are the only eukaryotic organism known to produce PGA.  Cnidaria use these explosive organelles to capture prey, for locomotion and for defence (Weber, 1990), and large amounts of PGA trigger this explosion.  Thus, anchored PGA is a bacterial virulence factor, protecting the pathogen from the immune system, whereas released PGA may be a persistence factor � protecting the bacterium from its environment � or a storage element for carbon and nitrogen precursors or for energy (Schreier, 1993).  \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nCandela T, Fouet A.  2006.

Four major operons could be associated with magnetite biomineralization, The deletion of the mamAB operon results in the complete loss of magnetic particles, deletion of the conserved mms6, mamGFDC, and mamXY operons leads to severe defects in morphology, size and organization of magnetite crystals. The later seem to be responsible for the formation and content of vesicles formed of the magnetosome membrane (MM). The small hydrophobic MamGFDC proteins account for nearly 35% of all proteins associated with the MM.\r\n",

MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY OBSOLETE OR SIMPLY CAPTURES THE PROCESS OF SUBSYSTEM ENCODING ETC. THEY MAY BE AS WELL DELETED OR AT LEAST IGNORED FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES.\n\nINTRODUCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF NMPDR ORGANISMS\nFatty acid biosynthesis is one of the most conserved components of bacterial biosynthetic machinery, (for recent reviews see  eg(Campbell and Cronan 2001; Heath et al. 2002)). With a few exceptions (such as in Mycoplasmas) Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) multienzyme complex is present in all bacteria and eukaryotes, but it is absent in archaea. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids participate in a number of cellular processes, most importantly in building the cell envelope. Most of the FAS-related genes are indispensable for cell growth and survival, as demonstrated in a number of gene essentiality studies in model (E.coli, B.subtilis) and  pathogenic (H.influenzae, S.aureus, S.pneumoniase) bacteria.\n\nEukaryotic and bacterial FAS drive fundamentally the same sequence of biochemical transformations, although structurally they are highly divergent. In eukarytotic (non-dissociable) FAS I, most of the catalytic domains are encoded in one gigantic modular polypeptide chain, In a typical bacterial (dissociable) FAS II, individual components (enzymes and carrier proteins) are encoded by separate genes.  Most (but not all) of these components are clearly homologous to functional domains of eukaryotic FAS I.  \n\nOne of the unique bacterial enzymes, encoded by the gene fabI in many bacterial species is a proven target for popular antibiotics, such as triclosan.  Recently it was shown that enoyl-ACP-reductase in S. pneumoniae (�missing� a classic fabI), is encoded by a nonhomologous gene fabK. This discovery was made based on the analysis of the conserved chromosomal cluster, which contains most of the FAS genes in Streptococci. An experimental verification of this prediction was published in the independent study (Heath and Rock 2000).\n\nFabK is very distantly related to FMN-dependent domain of eukaryotic FASI and is completely insensitive to the inhibitors of bacterial FabI, providing a rational for the known triclosan-resistance of S. pneumoniae and other bacteria with the same gene pattern. \n\nThe FAS subsystem analysis for a set of NMPDR organisms allows us to predict/rationalize the triclosan sensistivity/resistance based on the presense of FabI/FabK forms, in most cases except for Vibrio ssp.\n\nVibrio ssp represent a case of an open problem. None of them have strong candidates for FabI, although they contain several paralogs with relatively low scores having other functional assignments. Most of them (except Vibrio parahaemolyticus) also do not have string FabK candidates. Additional analysis (a combination of bioinformatics and experiments) will be required to elucidate this aspect of FAS in Vibrio ssp.\n\nAnother conclusion about the phenotype can be made by considering the presence of one of the two described branching pathways; Unsaturated Fatty Acids (. Vibrio ssp are likely is capable of producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids (UFA) using the same two-step fabB/fabA branching pathway as E.coli. \n\nAn alternative UFA branching pathway involving a universally conserved fabF gene and a relatively rare fabM gene was described in S.pneumoniae (Marrakchi et al. 2002), which does not have fabA/fabB homologs.  Remarkably, the discovery of fabM was also based on the evidence brought by genome context analysis (gene clustering, as discussed in (Osterman and Overbeek 2003)). This alternative UFA pathway is relatively rare, and it is apparently not present Staphylococci, Listeria and Campylobcater ssp. Genetics and enzymology of UFA synthesis these organisms remain to be explored.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n\nCampbell, J. W. and J. E.

See below for comments\nCurrent classification does not reflect upon AcpS/PPT profiling\n\n===============MISCELANEOUS NOTES========================\n1. FabI-FabK-FabL:\n- A variety of form in Enoyl-ACP-reductase. We all remember the story of \"missing fabI\" in S.pneumoniae, that we managed to predict a few months before the publication of C.Rock group in Nature,2000. This gene is now termed fabK. \nPROBLEM: homologs of fabK are present in many genomes, and not all of them are probably functional (for example yrpB in B.subtilis is claimed to be inactive by Heath et al, JBC 2000). IT SEEMS IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE THE WHOLE FAMILY and attempt to sort out paralogs. Clustering of fabK in several genomes shoudl be very helpful for this analysis. FabL (in B.subtilis) is another tough issue due to its confusing homology with FabG. \n\n2.Paralogs of FabG is another issue to address. More generally, the real task is to sort out genuine FAS from some polyketide synthases and other \"variations of the theme\". Requires case-by-case analysis.\n\n3. Missing AcpS. Most notably in H.influenzae. Here we have a solid prediction, made more than a year ago, that a nonhomologous PPT (HI0152) functionally replaces acpS. This prediction likely holds in several other genomes with that pattern (see table). Evidence:\n- homology with characterized PPTs involved in secondary metabolism (sfp in B.subtilis, yhhU in E.coli);\n- experimental results in E.coli, where overexpression of yhhU compensated for acpS defficiency;\n- essentiality of HI0152 in Mikelanos paper.\nSomebody should make an experiemnt. although, in fact, it seems obvious.\n\n4. Missing BC in four genomes (out of all bacteria I looked up so far). This is a bridging problem in this subsystem and in Biotin-dependent transcarboxylation in general. Genomes are: Thermotoga maritima. Fusobacetrium, Porphyromonas, adn Thermoanaerobacter (ALL ANAEROBES!). My working hypothesis for now is that BC is functionally replaced by pyruvate carboxyltransferase component (such as TM0128). That means that conversion of biotin to carboxy-biotin in the hypothesized tri-partite complex (PycB-BCCP-AccD/A: TM0128-TM0717-TM0716) occurs not from CO2 but from oxaloacatetate. This is a pretty radical conjecture and it must be experimentally verified (in progress).\nAlternatives are possible:\n- nonorthologous BC;\n- spontaneous charging by saturating CO2 concentrations.\n\n\nMiscellaneous problems:\nacpS in PA - open problem\ntoo many copies of fabG\nfabL story seems strange: too close to fabG?\nControversy with fabK homologs in bacilli:\nyrpB was shown to be inactive by Heath et al, JBC 2000,\nalthough its close homolog ois the only plausible candidate for enoylACP-reductase in B.anthracis\nFabZ is missing in a number of species (Mycobacteria, Chloroflex, etc). Use code 110\n\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\nApparently Corynebacteria don's have FASII (only FASI). Mycobacteria have both (FabZ missing?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},

        "description":"Photosynthetic (PS) organisms synthesize a variety of Mg-tetrapyrrols for light harvesting and energy-generating charge separation in PS reaction centers.  Cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, which evolve oxygen as byproduct of photosynthesis, typically synthesize chlorophyll a, b, or c.  Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria synthesize a variety of related tetrapyrrols: bacteriochlorophylls (Bchls) a and b, the most common types of bacteriochlorophyll, are main antenna and reaction center pigments in most purple bacteria.  Green sulfur bacteria synthesize Bchls c, d, or e.  In contrast to other Chls these can occur as more than one defined compound within a given organism (so called homologous mixtures).  Components of such mixtures differ by the nature of side groups at C8 and C12 and the type of the esterified alcohol at C17 (farnesol, octadec-9-en-1-ol, hexadecanol, octadecanol maybe found in addition to more common phytol and geranylgeraniol).  Bchl g, the sole pigment in Heliobacteriaceae is related to Bchl b.  Chlorophylls c1, c2, c3 are used as accessory light-harvesting pigments in many algae.  Only biosynthesis of Chl a and b, and Bchl a were included in this SS, since very little is known to date about biosynthetic pathways of all other (bacterio)chlorophylls. \r\n\r\n==============================\r\nThis subsystem incorporates the following AraCyc pathways:\r\nchlorophyllide a biosynthesis I: <a href=\"http://pmn.plantcyc.org/ARA/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=CHLOROPHYLL-SYN\">CHLOROPHYLL-SYN</a>\r\nchlorophyll a biosynthesis I: <a href=\"http://pmn.plantcyc.org/ARA/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5086\">PWY-5086</a>\r\nchlorophyll a biosynthesis II: <a href=\"http://pmn.plantcyc.org/ARA/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5064\">PWY-5064</a>\r\nchlorophyll cycle: <a href=\"http://pmn.plantcyc.org/ARA/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5068\">PWY-5068</a>\r\n",

Instead, AIH is clustered with Putrescine carbamoyltransferase, PTC (and often with Carbamate kinase, CK), indicating it�s involvement in arginine catabolism for ATP generation (and not putrescine biosynthesis)\r\n 5 = two routes can be asserted in a genome: ArgDC + AUH (for putrescine biosynthesis) and ArgDC + AIH + PTC + CK (for energy generation)\r\n 7 = no ArgDC branch, de novo putrescine biosynthesis might potentially occur via Ornithine decarboxylase\r\n 6 = no ArgDC branch, but putrescine/ornithine symporter is co-localized with Ornithine decarboxylase (like in some Shewanella) � uptake is the main source of putrescine?\r\n 8.1 = no de novo putrescine biosynthesis, an organism depends on extracellular polyamines (polyamine transporter(s) can be asserted). No spermidine synthase.\r\n 8.2 = no de novo putrescine biosynthesis, an organism depends on extracellular polyamines (polyamine transporter(s) can be asserted).  Spermidine synthase is present, apparently, only putrescine is being transported.\r\n 9 = Spermidine synthase is present, but the source of putrescine is not clear: neither de novo biosynthesis, nor transport can be asserted (overannotation?). This hypothesis is partially supported by the publication from 1963, which demonstrated putrescine uptake by Mycobacteria (https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/38628)\r\n* a start  with any variant code indicates, that gene complement is incomplete, for example CPA or AIH appear missing in the AIH+CPA route (or the other member of the branch is overannotated??)\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n  1. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is likely a missing gene in Corynebacteria and Mycobacteria, since Spermine synthase and 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase can be asserted in these genomes\r\n  2. In some Shewanellas both ArgDC-dependent routes (ArgDC + AUH and ArgDC  + AIH + CPA) are missing.  In spite the fact that they contain OrnDC, variant code #7 was not assigned.  The fact that putrescine/ornithine symporter is co-localized with Ornithine decarboxylase might indicate that  uptake (and not biosynthesis) is the main source of putrescine\r\n  3. In some Burkholderias CPA is present, while AIH cannot be found.  Missing gene?

        "description":"Polyamines are essential and ancient small polycation metabolites required for cell growth and proliferation and are found in most if not all bacterial, fungal, animal and plant cells (Illingworth et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2004; Tabor & Tabor, 1985).  The most common polyamines are putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) and spermidine; spermine is present largely in eukaryotes. In some microbial species (Vibrio, a number of archaea and thermophilic bacteria) the major polyamine is norspermidine.  The genes for norspermidine synthesis are present in the genomes of many members of the proteobacteria and of a few members of the deinococci, bacteroidetes, cyanobacteria, and gram-positive bacteria (Karatan et al., 2005)\r\n\r\nPutrescine is synthesized from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDC) or from arginine by the sequential actions of (i) arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase (ArgDC+AUH)  or (ii) arginine decarboxylase, Agmatine deiminase and N-carbamoylputrescine amidase (ArgDC+AIH+CPA).  \r\nIn well studied organisms, such as E. coli, two types of ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase can be distinguished: biodegradative (induced) and biosynthetic (constitutive) (Tabor and Tabor, 1985).  Extrapolation of these data has not been attempted for the majority of organisms in this SS.\r\n\r\nSpermidine synthase (SPDS) synthesizes spermidine from putrescine by the addition of an aminopropyl group acquired from  decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine formed by S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase (Woolridge, 1999). Similarly, spermine is formed from spermidine by spermine synthase  or spermidine synthase through addition of another aminopropyl group.  Spermidine and spermine can be further metabolized by acetylation (Casero et al., 1993).  In addition, uptake systems for putrescine, spermidine and spermine has been described for various microorganisms. In contrast to putrescine and spermidine, spermine is normally not present in media or under natural conditions.\r\n\r\nSeveral widely distributed Polyamine transport systems have been characterized (Igarashi et al., 1999; Woolridge et al., 1997).  In the absence of polyamine biosynthetic pathways one or more polyamine transport systems is likely to be present � but in many cases potential gene candidates were not annotated as such: impossible to predict a transporter�s substrate based on sequence alone. \r\n\r\nPolyamine metabolism has been targeted for therapeutic or preventative intervention in the treatment of certain diseases, based on the observation of increased polyamine concentration in a variety of diseases and parasitic infections (reviewed in Wallace, et al., 2004).\r\n\r\nSee also related subsystems:  Arginine Putrescine and 4-aminobutyrate degradation;  Putrescine utilization cluster; Biofilm formation in Vibrio.\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem has been originally encoded by Ines Thiele (UCSD), whose excellent contribution we gratefully acknowledge.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nCasero, R.

They are administered as prodrugs, and their activation depends upon an anaerobic 1-electron reduction of the nitro group by a reduction pathway in the cells. Bacterial resistance toward these drugs is thought to be caused by decreased drug uptake and/or an altered reduction efficiency. One class of resistant strains, identified in Bacteroides, has been shown to carry Nim genes (NimA, -B, -C, -D, and -E), which encode for reductases that convert the nitro group on the antibiotic into a non-bactericidal amine.\r\n\r\nPMID: 24448511\r\nmetronidazole resistance does occur in Bacteroides and has been mainly attributed to Nim proteins, a class of proteins with a suggested nitroreductase function.the data herein do not provide evidence for Nim proteins acting as nitroreductases using metronidazole as a substrate, because no correlation between Nim levels and levels of metronidazole resistance could be observed.

The di-adenylate cyclase activity is strongly suppressed by binding to branched DNA, but not to duplex or single-stranded DNA, suggesting a role for DisA as a monitor of the presence of stalled replication forks or recombination intermediates via DNA structure-modulated c-di-AMP synthesis. The resulting cyclic diadenosine phosphate, c-di-AMP, is reminiscent but distinct from c-di-GMP, a prokaryotic regulator of complex cellular processes. \r\n\r\nThe the size of the \"Uncharacterized secreted protein associated with spyDAC\" is very variable.\r\n\r\nThe \"Phosphoglucosamine mutase (EC 5.4.2.10)\" catalyzes the interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, an essential step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of peptidoglycan precursor uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine. Insertional glmM mutant of S. gordonii did not produce GlmM, and had a growth rate that was approximately half that of the wild type. Morphological analyses clearly indicated that the glmM mutation causes marked elongation of the streptococcal chains, enlargement of bacterial cells, and increased roughness of the bacterial cell surface. Furthermore, the glmM mutation reduces biofilm formation and increases sensitivity to penicillins.  Compared with the wild type glmM mutation resulted in increased sensitivity to PMN-dependent killing. GlmM may be required for synthesis of firm peptidoglycans for resistance to bacterial cell lysis. \r\n \r\n",

It is also a cofactor involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoid, a photosynthetic pigment.\r\nIn cyanobacteria plastoquinone is synthesized by the pathway propsed by Sandre et al.,2012 (PMID: 22166075), as posted under the Illustration tab. It differs significantly from the plastoquinone biosynthetic pathway in plants, which is encoded in SS: \"Plastoquinone biosynthesis in plants\".  Only the first and the last steps of the cyanobacterial pathway are currently known, the rest are still unresolved \r\n\r\nFrom PMID:22166075:\r\n\"During evolution, cyanobacterial ancestors have apparently lost the ability to synthesize ubiquinone and replaced it with PQ-9. Phylogenetically, Slr0926 (PlqA) probably originated from bacterial 4-hydroxybenzoate prenyltransferases involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, whereas plant HSTs may have evolved from a cyanobacterial homogentisate phytyltransferase for tocopherol biosynthesis. As shown in Figure 10, the use of 4-hydroxybenzoate as the prenyl acceptor necessitates further modifications at the aromatic ring such as decarboxylation, hydroxylation and two methylations to finally yield PQ-9. The Synechocystis sp. genome encodes homologues of the E. coli proteins UbiX/UbiD (decarboxylation), UbiH (hydroxylation) and UbiE (C-methylation) involved in the downstream reactions of UQ-8 biosynthesis. It is therefore very conceivable that the order of the reactions in cyanobacterial PQ-9 biosynthesis is similar to that in the course of UQ-8 biosynthesis in E. coli, with decarboxylation of 3-solanesyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and then hydroxylation preceding methylations of the aromatic ring at positions 2 and 3\"\r\n \n",

A comparison of protein amino acid sequences confirmed that Arabidopsis VTE3 is not an ortholog of the Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 MPBM/MSBM, because the two proteins share only 18% identity in their primary amino acid sequences. However, biochemical and genetic analyses showed that Arabidopsis VTE3 represents the functional equivalent of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 MPBQ/MSBQ MT. This finding is quite interesting from an evolutionary perspective, because all other enzymes of the tocopherol pathway are highly conserved between higher plants and cyanobacteria.\r\n    The finding indicates that, unlike Arabidopsis, functional redundancy exists for MPBM/MSBM  in Synechocystis sp PCC6803 and that this step in tocopherol and PQ synthesis has diverged significantly in cyanobacteria and plants( ref.#1). An Arabidopsis MPBM/MSBM was isolated and it was shown that it is the nonorthologous functional equivalent of its cyanobacterial counterpart. The Arabidopsis VTE3 gene encodes a protein and activity in tocopherol and PQ biosynthesis that are highly conserved in photosynthetic eukaryotes.\r\n\r\n================References:=============================\r\n\r\n1.

        "description":"Tetracyclines (TET) were discovered in the 1940s and exhibited activity against a wide range of microorganisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, rickettsiae, and protozoan parasites. The first tetracycline-resistant bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae, was isolated in 1953. It was in fact the inquiry into molecular mechanisms of TET resistance that opened up the entire field of antimicrobial resitance (ISBN 1-55581-329-1) \r\n\r\nTetracycline resistance is most often due to the acquisition of new genes, which encode either (i) energy-dependent efflux of tetracyclines or (ii) a protein that protects bacterial ribosomes from the action of tetracyclines (Chopra and Roberts, 2001). Ribosomal protection proteins and TET efflux pumps are the two main mechanisms of TET resistance. In addition, a limited number of bacteria acquire resistance by mutations, which alter the permeability of the outer membrane porins and/or lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane, change the regulation of innate efflux systems, or alter the 16S rRNA.  Reviewed in (Chopra and Roberts, 2001)\r\n\r\nOver 50 types of TET resistant determinants have been described so far, and new ones are being reported. \r\nDr. Stuart Levy (Tufts University) has initiated the clearinghouse for naming new TET genes. A new gene must have <79% amino acid identity with all previous characterized TET genes to be recorded.  A detailed up-to-date database is currently maintained by prof.

        "description":"This subsystem encodes a head-to-head fatty acid condensation biosynthetic pathway dependent on genes denoted as ole (for olefin biosynthesis). It was deciphered in a series of publications by Sukovich and colleagues (ref.2-3) and independently by Keasling group (ref.1).  The same cluster was independently predicted to be involved in biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids or related compounds by this database (see \"Notes\" section below)\r\n\r\nSukovich et al. (ref.3) tested experimentally selected microorganisms from the phyla Verucomicrobia, Planctomyces, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria and showed that they produce long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons. However, different species from the same genera sometimes lack the ole genes and fail to produce olefinic hydrocarbons. The type of olefins produced by different bacteria differed greatly with respect to the number of carbon-carbon double bonds. The greatest number of organisms surveyed biosynthesized a single long-chain olefin, 3,6,9,12,15,19,22,25,28-hentriacontanonaene, that contains nine double bonds (ref.3).\r\n\r\nIt was further proposed (ref.2) that these long-chain polyunsaturated compounds aid in adapting cells to a rapid drop in temperature, based on three observations. In S. oneidensis wild-type cells, the cellular concentration of polyunsaturated compounds increased significantly with decreasing growth temperature. Second, the oleABCD deletion strain showed a significantly longer lag phase than the wild-type strain when shifted to a lower temperature. Lastly, compound I has been identified in a significant number of bacteria isolated from cold environments (ref.2).  \r\n\r\n    This observation is fully supported in this SS by the fact that the OLE operon often co-occurs and co-localizes with the pfaABCD(E) operon, controlling biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic (DHA) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, important in bacterial cold adaptation\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.Beller HR, Goh EB, Keasling JD. 2010.

        "notes":["Hypothesis for At1g52510 and AT4G12830: These Arabidopsis proteins are associated with some aspect of polyunsaturated fatty acids  metabolism in chloroplasts\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS\r\nDue to the fact that At1g52510 and AT4G12830 belong to a diverse family �Hydrolase, alpha/beta fold� family, annotation of their bacterial homologs was performed so as to keep groupings isofunctional. For that purpose different branches of the tree were assigned with different Functional Roles. The following two Prokaryotic subgroups appear to be the closest to At1g52510 and AT4G12830:\r\n\r\n1. �Hydrolase, alpha/beta fold family protein, At1g52510/AT4G12830 homolog�\r\n2. \"Haloalkane dehalogenase-like protein\" (OleB)\r\n\r\nThe OleB proteins (subgroup #2) were recently shown to be involved in olefin biosynthesis (ref. 1-3). \r\n\r\nIt is likely, that function of the \"Hydrolase, alpha/beta fold family protein, At1g52510/AT4G12830 homolog\" (subgroup #1) is also associated with some aspect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) metabolism, because:\r\n\r\n(i) out of all bacterial homologs this small subgroup seems to have the highest homology with At1g52510 and AT4G12830.  It�s members occurs only in SOME cyanobacterial species. \r\n\r\n(ii) cyanobacteria are known to produce PUFAs - catalyzed by �classic� desaturases (not by Pfa enzymes), just like plants or other eukaryotes\r\n\r\n(iii) members of the \"Hydrolase, alpha/beta fold family protein, At1g52510/AT4G12830 homolog\" family are absent from the genome of Thermosynechocus, which is known to lack highly unsaturated fatty acids in lipids and contains only one &#8710;9 desaturase in contrast with mesophilic cyano strains, (likely due to its thermic habitat, where membrane &#64258;uidity is increased, and hence, FA desaturation is unnecessary).\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to compare the pattern of the absence/presence of At1g52510/AT4G12830 homologs in different cyano genomes with the complement of various desaturases in each, which differs significantly among cyanos (see recent review by Chi et al.,2008: Comparative Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturases in Cyanobacterial Genomes).  This comparison might help generate specific functional prediction for this subgroup of the At1g52510//AT4G12830 homologs. For example, �pathway of acyl-lipid desaturation for unicellular marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus di&#64256;ers from that of other cyanos� (according to Chi et al., 2008), and these are the strains that lack members of this protein subfamily. \r\n\r\nGene clustering: Members if this subgroup are NOT involved in any conserved clustering, but this is common in cyanobacteria (even genes known to cluster in other taxa hardly ever cluster in these organisms)\r\n\r\n\r\n===============  EARLIER PREDICTION (as of Feb 2010)m verified by others =======\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem encodes a hypothetical gene cluster, which includes a hydrolase of alpha/beta fold family, putative 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase;  AMP-acid ligase/peptide synthase; and a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase family protein\r\n\r\nWe hypothesize that this putative operon might be involved in microbial biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids via anaerobic pathway (resembling polyketide synthesis).  This hypothesis is based on the observation, that this cluster often co-occurs (and in several cases is co-localized with) the pfaABCD(E) operon, controlling biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and/or docosahexaenoic (DHA) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Yazawa, 1996; Tanaka et al., 1999; Metz et al., 2001) \r\n\r\nFor additional info on the pfa operon see SS: \"Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids synthesis\"\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nYazawa, K. 1996.

        "description":"Subunit composition of photosystem II (PSII) complex can be used as \"quality control\" of sorts for ORF calling algorithms used by different sequencing centers: from 34 - 36 transmembrane a-helices revealed in PSII via electron and X-ray crystallography (in plants and cyanobacteria respectively), at least 12�14 are attributed to low molecular mass proteins  --  merely 25 to 60 amino acids in size, each containing a single trans-membrane span.  These ORFs are often overlooked, even the ones stably clustered into operons in the majority of cyanobacterial genomes.  The situation is especially bad in the genomes of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, two subunits (PsbU and PsbV) are missing �for real� from some cyanobacterial genomes indicating that some degree of plasticity may exist in the composition of PSII. \r\n\r\nCollectively, there are at least 18 and possibly more than 25 distinct subunits in PSII from cyanobacteria and plants, as compared to only three or four in the non-oxygenic bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers.  The evolutionary source of most of these \"additional\" proteins is enigmatic, as they have no apparent homology to any other proteins in existing databases.  However, some of the proteins in PSII have apparent homologies to each other, suggesting ancient gene duplications have played an important role in the development of the complex. This suggests that a period of remarkable evolutionary innovation took place when the ability to make oxygen was invented, leading to explosion in complexity of photosynthetic machinery.  Cyanobacterial and eukaryotic PSII complexes are very close, differing in only a few subunits.  This implies that nearly entire spectrum of PSII proteins had originated by the time the first plastid endosymbiosis occurred and has hardly changed since.\r\n\r\nProteins annotated here as �Chlorophyll a(b) binding protein, photosystem II CP43 protein (PsbC) homolog� are not PSII subunits per ser.  In the genera of prochlorophytes (including Prochloron, Prochlorothrix, and Prochlorococcus) lacking phycobilisomes, these proteins form light-harvesting antenna (binding both, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b), while their homologs in cyanobacteria encode chlorophyll a binding protein IsiA, expressed exclusively under conditions of iron starvation.  In addition, Nostoc PCC 7120 and Trichodesmium erythraeum contain multiple PsbC homologs of yet unknown function, while a few other species contain none.  This protein family is closely related to the PSII chlorophyll-binding protein PsbC and � more distantly -- PsbB.\r\n\r\nUse \"show clusters\" to view this Subsystem - many PSII-related genes are beautifully clustered in various combinations.\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nThis subsystem covers protein complexes involved in a single AraCyc reaction:\r\nphotosystem II: <a href=\"http://pmn.plantcyc.org/PLANT/NEW-IMAGE?type=REACTION&object=PSII-RXN\">PSII-RXN</a>\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.

The\r\n    genes belonging to the PurR regulon (purR, purA, glyA, guaC, pbuO,\r\n    pbuG, and the pur, yqhZ-folD, and xpt-pbuX operons) are controlled\r\n    by the PurR repressor, which inhibits transcription\r\n    initiation. Other genes are regulated by a less-well-described\r\n    transcription termination mechanism that responds to the presence\r\n    of hypoxanthine and guanine. The pur operon and the xpt-pbuX\r\n    operon, which were studied here, are regulated by both\r\n    mechanisms. We isolated two mutants resistant to 2-fluoroadenine\r\n    in which the pur operon and the xpt-pbuX operon are expressed at\r\n    increased levels in a PurR-independent manner. The mutations were\r\n    caused by deletions that disrupted a potential transcription\r\n    terminator structure located immediately upstream of the ydhL\r\n    gene. The 5' part of the ydhL leader region contained a\r\n    63-nucleotide (nt) sequence very similar to the 5' ends of the\r\n    leaders of the pur and xpt-pbuX operons. Transcripts of these\r\n    regions may form a common tandem stem-loop secondary\r\n    structure. Two additional genes with potential leader regions\r\n    containing the 63-nt sequence are pbuG, encoding a\r\n    hypoxanthine-guanine transporter, and yxjA, which was shown to\r\n    encode a purine nucleoside transporter and is renamed\r\n    nupG. Transcriptional lacZ fusions and mutations in the 63-nt\r\n    sequence encoding the possible secondary structures provided\r\n    evidence that expression of the pur and xpt-pbuX operons and\r\n    expression of the ydhL, nupG, and pbuG genes are regulated by a\r\n    common mechanism. The new pur regulon is designated the XptR\r\n    regulon. Except for ydhL, the operons and genes were negatively\r\n    regulated by hypoxanthine and guanine. ydhL was positively\r\n    regulated. The derived amino acid sequence encoded by ydhL (now\r\n    called pbuE) is similar to the amino acid sequences of metabolite\r\n    efflux pumps. When overexpressed, PbuE lowers the sensitivity to\r\n    purine analogs. Indirect evidence indicated that PbuE decreases\r\n    the size of the internal pool of hypoxanthine. This explains why\r\n    the hypoxanthine- and guanine-regulated genes are expressed at\r\n    elevated levels in a mutant that overexpresses pbuE.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 12923093\r\n\r\n===========  REGULATION VIA PurR =======================\r\npurR                  fig|224308.1.peg.47\r\npurA                  fig|224308.1.peg.4048  Adenylosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.4)\r\nglyA                  fig|224308.1.peg.3697  Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1)\r\nguaC/yumD             fig|224308.1.peg.3219  GMP reductase (EC 1.7.1.7)\r\nycbB                  fig|224308.1.peg.637   Xanthine/uracil/thiamine/ascorbate permease family protein\r\npbuO/ytiP             fig|224308.1.peg.3002  Xanthine/uracil/thiamine/ascorbate permease family protein\r\npbuG/ytjP             fig|224308.1.peg.3001  Xaa-His dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.3)\r\npur operon            fig|224308.1.peg.643-654\r\nyqhZ-folD operon      fig|224308.1.peg.2436 (yqhZ) 2435 (folD)\r\nxpt-pbuX operon       fig|224308.1.peg.2212 (xpt) 2211 (pbuX)\r\n===========\r\n\r\n J Bacteriol. 1999 Jun;181(12):3810-5.\r\n\r\n    A role for a highly conserved protein of unknown function in regulation of Bacillus subtilis purA by the purine repressor.\r\n\r\n    Rappu P, Shin BS, Zalkin H, M�nts�l� P.\r\n\r\n \r\n    Regulation of the purine biosynthetic gene purA was examined by using a transcriptional fusion to a luciferase reporter gene. Transcription was repressed about 10-fold by the addition of adenine and increased approximately 4.5-fold by the addition of guanosine. This regulation is mediated by a purine repressor (PurR). In a purR mutant, basal expression was increased 10-fold, and there was no further stimulation by guanosine or repression by adenine. An open reading frame, yabJ, immediately downstream from purR was found to have a role in the repression of purA by adenine. Repression by adenine was perturbed in a purR+ yabJ mutant, although guanosine regulation was retained. Mutations in the PurR PRPP binding motif abolished guanosine regulation in the yabJ mutant. Thus, PRPP appears to be required for upregulation by guanosine. The amino acid sequence of YabJ is homologous to the YER057c/YjgF protein family of unknown function.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 10368157\r\n\r\n=============\r\n\r\nNote in the following paper an assertion that PurR functions in Streptococcus:\r\n\r\nJ Bacteriol. 2003 Jan;185(1):359-70.\r\n\r\n    Transcriptional regulation and signature patterns revealed by microarray analyses of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 challenged with sublethal concentrations of translation inhibitors.\r\n    Ng WL, Kazmierczak KM, Robertson GT, Gilmour R, Winkler ME.\r\n\r\n    The effects of sublethal concentrations of four different classes of translation inhibitors (puromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin) on global transcription patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were determined by microarray analyses. Consistent with the general mode of action of these inhibitors, relative transcript levels of genes that encode ribosomal proteins and translation factors or that mediate tRNA charging and amino acid biosynthesis increased or decreased, respectively. Transcription of the heat shock regulon was induced only by puromycin or streptomycin treatment, which lead to truncation or mistranslation, respectively, but not by other antibiotics that block translation, transcription, or amino acid charging of tRNA. In contrast, relative transcript amounts of certain genes involved in transport, cellular processes, energy metabolism, and purine nucleotide (pur) biosynthesis were changed by different translation inhibitors. In particular, transcript amounts from a pur gene cluster and from purine uptake and salvage genes were significantly elevated by several translation inhibitors, but not by antibiotics that target other cellular processes. Northern blotting confirmed increased transcript amounts from part of the pur gene cluster in cells challenged by translation inhibitors and revealed the presence of a 10-kb transcript. Purine metabolism genes were negatively regulated by a homologue of the PurR regulatory protein, and full derepression in a DeltapurR mutant depended on optimal translation. Unexpectedly, hierarchical clustering of the microarray data distinguished among the global transcription patterns caused by antibiotics that inhibit different steps in the translation cycle. Together, these results show that there is extensive control of transcript amounts by translation in S. pneumoniae, especially for de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. In addition, these global transcription patterns form a signature that can be used to classify the mode of action and potential mechanism of new translation inhibitors.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 12486074 \r\n\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nNote that in Lactococcus PurR activates expression.  Hence, I am changing my general annotation to just mention regulation: activation or repression will need to be studied carefully over a set of organisms.\r\n\r\nJ Bacteriol. 1998 Aug;180(15):3907-16.\r\n\r\n    A transcriptional activator, homologous to the Bacillus subtilis PurR repressor, is required for expression of purine biosynthetic genes in Lactococcus lactis.\r\n\r\n    Kilstrup M, Martinussen J.\r\n\r\n    A purR::pGh9:ISS1 mutant of Lactococcus lactis was obtained following transposon mutagenesis of strain MG1363 and selection for purine auxotrophs. After determination of the nucleotide sequence and deduction of the purR reading frame, the PurR product was found to be highly similar to the purR-encoded repressor from Bacillus subtilis. The wild-type purR gene complemented the purine auxotrophy of a purR::ISS1 mutant, and it was shown that the purR::ISS1 mutation lowered the level of transcription from the purine-regulated L. lactis purD promoter. In a parallel study on the regulation of purC and purD expression in L. lactis (M. Kilstrup, S. G. Jessing, S. B. Wichmand-Jorgensen, M. Madsen, and D. Nilsson, J. Bacteriol. 180:3900-3906, 1998), we identified regions (PurBox sequences: AWWWCCGAACWWT) upstream of the promoters with a central G residue at exactly position -76 relative to the transcriptional start site. The PurBox sequences were found to be required for high-level promoter activity and purine regulation. We identified a PurBox sequence overlapping the -35 region of the L. lactis purR promoter and found, by studies of a purR-lacLM fusion plasmid, that purR is autoregulated. Because of the high degree of similarity of the PurR proteins from B. subtilis and L. lactis, we looked for PurBox sequences in the promoter regions of the PurR-regulated genes in B. subtilis and identified a perfectly matching PurBox sequence in the purA promoter region and slightly degenerate PurBox-like sequences in the promoter regions for the pur operon and the purR gene. Interestingly, the PurBox in the pur operon of B. subtilis is located almost identically, with respect to the promoter, to the PurBox sequences located in front of purC and purD in L. lactis. We present a hypothesis to explain how an ancestral PurR protein in B. subtilis could have evolved from an activator of the pur operon into a repressor which regulates transcription initiation from the same pur promoter by using the same PurR binding site and a similar response toward its effectors.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 9683488\r\n"]},

        "description":"The bacterial catabolism of steroids has importants as a potential means of producing bioactive steroids from natural, low-cost sterols such as &#946;-sitosterol and cholesterol. A pathway responsible for the aerobic degradation of the latter via 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) and 3-hydroxy-9,10-seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione (3-HSA) may be pieced together from biochemical and genetic studies in diverse bacteria. In some Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus species, the aliphatic side chain at C17 is removed via a process similar to &#946;-oxidation involving progressively shorter carboxylic acids. In these strains, 3-ketosteroid &#916;1-dehydrogenase (KSTD) and 3-ketosteroid 9&#945;-hydroxylase catalyze the opening of ring B and aromatization of ring A to yield 3-HSA. The subsequent degradation of 3-HSA to 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oic acid (DOHNAA) via oxygenolytic cleavage of ring A is specified by the tes genes in the testosterone-degrading strain Comamonas testosteroni TA441. In Rhodococcus equi, the propionate moiety of DOHNAA is removed via &#946;-oxidation. Many of the genes involved in steroid catabolism have yet to be identified, and many of the pathway enzymes are poorly characterized, particularly those involved in degrading the bicycloalkanone originating from rings C and D.\r\n",

        "description":"Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) kinases are a sequence-conserved family of enzymes, which utilize two different phosphoryl donors: ATP in animals, plants, and some bacteria, and a phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) in most bacteria.  ATP- and PTS-dependent DHA kinases display a strikingly high degree of sequence and structure similarity.  However, ATP-dependent kinases are generally two-domain proteins, while PTS-dependent kinases are hetero-oligomeric complexes.  Both types of DHA kinase invariably contain two subunits/domains: the DhaK subunit/domain covalently binds dihydroxyacetone, while DhaL contains the nucleotide-binding site.   In the ATP-dependent kinase, ATP/ADP exchange is fast.  In the PTS-dependent kinase, however, ADP is essentially irreversibly bound to DhaL (DhaL-ADP). Here, ADP serves as a cofactor, which is in situ rephosphorylated by a phosphoprotein of the PTS.  The PTS-dependent kinases contain an additional subunit, DhaM.   In E. coli DhaM consists of three domains, which are homologous to the PTS proteins enzyme I (EI), HPr, and the IIA domain of the PTS transporter for mannose of E. coli.  The three domains conduct phosphoryl groups from the general phosphorylcarrier protein HPr of the PTS to the DhaL-ADP complex (Gutknecht et al., 2001).  In other organisms the length of a DhaM subunit can vary greatly, reflecting the presence of (i) only IIA domain, (ii) IIA and HPr domains;  or of all three domains (as in the E. coli DhaM).  DhaM serves as the shuttle for the transfer of phosphate from the bacterial PEP: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) to the Dha kinase. \n\nA very high degree of sequence and structure similarity between the two types of DHA kinases, makes it impossible to distinguish the two based on sequence data alone.  Hence, the presence/absence of a dhaM homolog in the immediate vicinity of the dhaK and dhaL genes (almost invariably clustered) was used to discern them.  Fusion of the two domains into a single DhaK-DhaL polypeptide, characteristic of the ATP-dependent DHA kinases was considered another indicator.  However, in several organisms (var. code 2.2) two unfused polypeptides DhaK and DhaL without recognizable DhaM subunits in the same loci were detected.  Their specificity is not clear, they are temporarily annotated as �putative ATP-dependent DHA kinases� (even though general Phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase of PTS system (EC 2.7.3.9) and Phosphocarrier protein H can be detected elsewhere in these genomes, e.g. fig|272843.1.peg.897: Pasteurella multocida)\n\nReferences\n\n1.

        "description":"The LiaRS system originally identified in Bacillus subtilis (Fabret et al., 1999) as one of the signaling system sensing  the cell envelope stress in this organism (Mascher et al., 2003).  It is linked by genomic context and function to liaF, encoding a membrane protein that acts as a specific inhibitor of LiaRS. The abbreviation �Lia� stands for �lipid II cycle interfering antibiotic response regulator and sensor� (Mascher et al., 2004).\n\nPhylogenomic studies revealed that LiaFRS is a conserved cell envelope stress-sensing regulatory system present in many Firmicutes (Jordan et al., 2006; 2008).  The orthologous systems were characterized in Streptococcus mutans UA159 (PMID:19251860), Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 (PMID:20118250) and Staphylococcus aureus  (as VraTRS) (PMID: 23070169). In B. subtilis and S. mutans, the LiaFSR system is usually activated by the presence of antibiotics that disrupt cell-membrane and peptidoglycan synthesis through alterations of lipid-II metabolism (i.e., bacitracin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, nisin, and vancomycin) (Mascher et al., 2004; Pietiainen etal., 2005; Hachmann etal., 2009; Wecke et al., 2009). It is also weakly induced by other more unspecific stresses that interfere with envelope integrity, such as alkaline shock and secretion stress (Wiegert et al., 2001; Hyyrylainen et al., 2005).\n\nLiaR positively autoregulates the expression of the liaIH-liaGFSR operon from a strictly LiaR- dependent promoter (PMID: 23279150).  \n \nThe three-component system VraTSR (vancomycin resistance associated sensor/regulator) in Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to regulate cell-wall peptidoglycan synthesis, and is involved in the expression of beta-lactam and glycopeptide resistance (PMID:23070169, PMID:12864861) It's homologous to the LiaSR TCS of Bacilli (see SS Bacitracin Stress Response). \n",

        "description":"A large number of new bacteriocins in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been characterized in recent years. Most of the new bacteriocins belong to the class II bacteriocins which are small (30-100 amino acids) heat-stable and commonly not post-translationally modified.  These bacteriocins render the  membrane of target cells permeable to various small molecules. \n    The majority of class II bacteriocins are synthesized in a preform containing an N-terminal double-glycine leader.  The double-glycine leader-containing bacteriocins are processed and secreted by a dedicated ABC-transporter which has been shown to possess an N-terminal proteolytic domain. This characteristic GG motif has been used here to predict yet uncharacterized putative bacteriocins (or inducing peptides for bacteriocin synthesis - see below)\n   The genes encoding the two peptides of two-peptide  bacteriocins are often colocalized with the genes encoding (i) the immunity protein that protects the bacteriocin-producing bacteria, (ii) a dedicated ABC  transporter and (iii) a three-component regulatory system that  consists of a  membrane-associated histidine protein kinase, response regulator, and inducing peptides or pheromone-like peptides, that functions to induce bacteriocin expression in response to cell density, stress or other external factors (Diep et al. 2000). Pheromone-like peptides usually possess characteristics similar to that of the bacteriocin peptides (including double-glycine leader), but do not possess any antimicrobial activity\n  These 3 groups of functions along with bacteriocin structural genes constitute the minimal set of functional roles required for bacteriocin production. An effort was made in this SS to identify them in the majority of Lactobacilli with sequenced genomes.  However, omissions are very likely (by both, ORF calling software and curator) due to very small size of bacteriocin structural genes and extremely low similarity levels between them.  Also, additional genes (most of them hypothetical), that are often present in the immediate vicinity of various bacteriocin genes and are likely involved in their biosynthesis, modification or secretion, have NOT been encoded here.  The only exception - plantaricin biosynthetic genes - they are included in this SS as an example. \n   For bacteriocins that have been described in the literature, specific names are given on the corresponding PEG pages - as a comment, separated from the main annotation by [#] sign\n\nReferences - \n(Many! only several recent reviews are quoted here)\n\n1.

Other siderophores in this group include rhizobactin 1021, achromobactin, vibrioferrin, alcaligin, and desferrioxamine E (reviewed by Challis, 2005).  Such siderophores are assembled from alternating dicarboxylic acid and diamine or amino alcohol building blocks (which are nevertheless derived from amino acids) linked by amide or ester bonds (Challis GL. 2005).

        "description":"Quoted from PubMed:22046172 (van Hoek et al., 2011) -\r\n\"The first macrolide, erythromycin A, was discovered in the early 1950s (McGuire et al., 1952). The main structural component of this molecule is a large lactone ring to which amino and/or neutral sugars are attached by glycosidic bonds.\r\n    Macrolides have a similar mode of antibacterial action and comparable antibacterial spectra as two other antibiotic classes, i.e., lincosamides and streptogramins B. Consequently, these antibiotics, although chemically distinct, have been grouped together as Macrolide�Lincosamide�Streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics (Roberts, 2002). Recently this class of antibiotics was extended due to the development to include synthetic drugs: the ketolides (Zhanel et al., 2002; Ackermann and Rodloff, 2003) and oxazolidinones (Diekema and Jones, 2000), which resulted in the MLSKO family of antibiotics (Roberts, 2008).\r\n    Macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins B inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria (Weisblum, 1995; Roberts, 2002)�\r\n\r\nBacterial resistance mechanisms to these antibiotics include rRNA methylases, ABC-F type ribosomal protection proteins, efflux pumps, and drug inactivating enzymes (Roberts et al., 1999; Roberts, 2008). The latter group can be further subdivided in esterases, lyases, phosphorylases, and transferases. This Subsystem encodes only the latter type of resistance. Three additiona Subsystems cover other (MLSKO) resistance mechanisms \r\n\r\nThe most common mechanism of MLS resistance is due to the presence of rRNA methylases, encoded by the erm genes. These enzymes methylate the adenine residue(s) resulting in MLS resistance. The methylated adenine prevents the binding of the drugs from binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. \r\n\r\n\n\n\n",

        "description":"This SS lists proven \"metabolite repair\" enzymes, as well as other characterized enzymes, that could potentially be involved in house cleaning functions (even if they have not been formally associated with this area of metabolism yet).  In addition, protein families involved in conserved clustering with such enzymes are included in this SS as well (they are labeled \"AUX\", auxiliary)\r\n\r\n\"Repair reactions are well known in the case of DNA and their importance does not need to be underlined. A few protein-repair mechanisms are also known (Clarke 2003; Del pi erre et al 2000; Moskovitz 2005; Veiga-da-Cunha et al 2006) and many more remain probably to be identified. Metabolites may also need to be repaired and this may be the role of many putative enzymes with unknown function encoded by the human and other genomes (Galperin et al 2006).  Abnormal_ metabolites may be formed through chemical reactions (e.g. the oxidation of nucleotides by reactive oxygen species; the reaction of amines with glucose and other sugars to form Schiff bases and ketoamines) or owing to the imperfection of enzymes. This latter point�the imperfection of enzymes�is probably underestimated...\" (Quoted from: Van Schaftingen & Rzem, 2009)\r\n",

J Inherit Metab Dis, 32(2):135-42. PMID: 19020988 \r\nSummary \r\nThe neurometabolic disorder L-2-hydroxy-glutaric aciduria is caused by mutations in a gene present on chromosome 14q22.1 and encoding L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. This FAD-linked mitochondrial enzyme catalyses the irreversible conversion of L-2-hydroxyglutarate to alpha-ketoglutarate. The formation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate results from a side-activity of mitochondrial L-malate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that interconverts oxaloacetate and L-malate, but which also catalyses, very slowly, the NADH-dependent conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to L-2-hydroxyglutarate. L-2-Hydroxyglutarate has no known physiological function in eukaryotes and most prokaryotes. Its accumulation is toxic to the mammalian brain, causing a leukoencephalopathy and increasing the susceptibility to develop tumours. L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria appears to be the first disease of \"metabolite repair\"\r\n\r\n5. Messy biology and the origins of evolutionary innovations. Tawfik DS.

THEY MAY BE AS WELL DELETED OR AT LEAST IGNORED FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES.\r\nThis is a merger of the two subsystems:\r\n1. NAD and NADP cofactor biosynthesis (w/o Trp pathway)\r\n2, Quinolinate Biosynthesis from Tryptophan\r\n\r\nHere I began to experiment with amultipositional definition of fucntional variants.\r\nEvery postion in a 4-digit number (of the form ABCD) reflects the status of a module.\r\n\r\nNote: variant codes have been assigned manually and later checked with \"set_variants\" tool. nevertheless, errors are inevitable.\r\n\r\nModule A: de novo biosynthesis:\r\n\"bacterial\" pathway from Asp to Quinol variant codes:\r\n1. ASPOX, QSYN, QAPRT (as in many bacteria and archaea);\r\n2. ASPDH, QSYN, QAPRT (as in T.maritima and some archaea;\r\n3. ?????, QSYN, QAPRT (as in H.pylori);\r\n\"euakryotic\" pathway from Trp to Quinol variant codes:\r\n4. TDO;IDO, *KFA;?, KMO, KYN, HAD\r\n(* - both types or even missing - same code)\r\n8. none\r\n9. something else is missing (eg QSYN appears missing in some bacteria)\r\n(NB: The presence of TOD, KFA and KYN only is characteristic of anthranilate pathway (see Kurnasov et al. They are disregarded in classification (except when they participate in Trp de novo pathway). Also involved in quinolobactin, see separate SS)\r\n\r\nModule B: universal pathway:\r\n\r\n1. *PNAT, NADS, ?????, NADK  (a very abundant missing GAT case)\r\n2. *PNAT, NADS, GAT, NADK \r\n8. none\r\n9. something else is missing\r\n\r\nModule C: B3 salvage\r\n1.NAM, NAPRT (2-step salvage of nicotinamide)\r\n2.---, NAPRT (salvage of nicotinic acid or unknown amidase)\r\n3.NMPRT (+NMNAT) (1-step salvage of nicotinamide, bypass NADS)\r\n4. both 1;2 and 3\r\n8. none\r\n\r\nModule D: salvage of nicotinamide ribose, NAD\r\n1. pnuC, RNK_b, NMNAT (as in H.influenzae, see Kurnasov et al)\r\n2. pnuC, RNK_b, ---- (as in P.aeruginosa, see Kurnasov et al)\r\n3. RNK_e (as in yeast, mice)\r\n4. UNSUAL SALVAGE of NAD (as in some intracellular bacteria)\r\n8. None\r\n\r\nSee Forum postings for more details and comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nMissing issues:\r\n1. NADK:\r\nLeptospira interrogans (candidate by Psi-blast), \r\nThermus, Deinococcus. methylobacillus\r\n\r\n2. ASPOX: H.pylori\r\n\r\n3. KFA is missing in many: put code 4, REGARDLESS\r\n(Missing  KFA in Xanthomonas pathway.\r\nCandidates:\r\npeg2245)\r\n\r\n4. QSYN in some\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\n- very interesting: in all Streptococcus pneumoniae and pyogenes there is a stand-alone QAPRT in transposase environment. Evolution (horizontal transfer) in making! No other context, but it can probably salvage human quinolinate. Would be especially cool if they would correlate with some known syndromes where quinolinate is elevated.\r\n- in Shewanella, strangely QAPRT is missing (more cases)\r\n- Interesting comparison of Wolinella vs Campylo 1 vs 9 in de novo.\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\nNOTES FROM OLD \"NAD and NADP cofactor biosynthesis\" \r\nObservations and comments:\r\n0. The first step is driven by ASPOX in most bacteria. T,maritima and several anaerobic archaea have an alternative enzyme: ASPDH\r\n1. H.pylori and several other genomes have a missing gene problem in the first step of de novo biosynthesis from Aspartate. The only reasonable guess is a broadening of succinate dehydorgenase specificity?\r\n2. The source of amide (Gln or Asn?) and a gene encoding \"GAT\" function for those genomes that have a single-domain NADS is an open question.\r\n3. NAMNAT comes in two flavors: \r\n- NadD-tike as in most bacteria with a higher oreference for NaMN over NMN as a substrte (from ~10x in H.pylori to ~ 15,000x as in S.aureus, see Gerdes et al., J.Bacteriology,2002). \r\n- In most eukaryotes, it is bi-functional PNAT with comparable preference to both NMN and NaMN. These  two forms are only very distantly related by sequence, although share many elements of 3D structure. Typical Rossman fold/\"HIGH\" motif adenylyltransferase.\r\n4. NMNAT comes in 3+ flavors:\r\n- typical archaeal form (nadM-like). Strict preference for NMN\r\n- version of it in some bacteria (such as Synechocystis) is fused with Nudix hydrolase domain (ADPR)\r\n- eukaryotoc PNAT (see above)\r\n- NadR-like. Always fused with RNK domain. This bi-fucntional protein is the only NAD biosynthetic route in most pasteurellaceae. In enterics NadR has a third, N-terminal HTH-domain (transcription regulator of de novo biosynthesis.\r\n5. NRK comes in two flavors: bacterial (as in multifunctional NadR proteins) and eukaryotic, as recently found in H.sapiens and yeast.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnotation of KFA based on mouse experimental evidence\r\nTDO and IDO redundant\r\n\r\n========\r\nRecent comments:\r\nSoluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1) added, but no real seriosu analysis done (geneudhA in E.coli) a clear issue ius resolving with lipoamide dehydrogenase (does it even make sense?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"]},

There are two different routes to catabolize 5-dehydro-4-deoxyglucarate:\r\n1. As in E.coli: The GarL aldolase splits it to pyruvate and tartronate semialdehyde, and the latter is reduced by the GarR reductase, phosphorylated by GarK kinase to produce 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of Glycolysis.\r\n2. as in B.subtilis: The 5-dehydro-4-deoxyglucarate dehydratase (decarboxylating), or KdgD, produces 2,5-dioxopentanoate which is then metabolized to 2-oxoglutarate by a common dehydrogenase.\r\n\r\nMany species lack D-galactarate and D-glucarate utilization genes but have only D-glycerate kinase in a cluster with predicted D-glycerate transporter (a homolog of the gluconate permease GntP), and with the sugar diacid regulator sdaR.\r\n\r\nSugar diacid regulator SdaR was characterized only in E.coli, where it co-regulates genes D-galactarate and D-glucarate catabolism and where D-glycerate transporter is missed. However it seems that SdaR senses D-glycerate, a common intermediate of D-galactarate and D-glucarate catabolism. In many other Gram-negative and Gram-positive species SdaR was found in a cluster with D-glycerate kinase and transporter, thus confirming that it sence D-glycerate.\r\n\r\nIn some taxonomic groups D-galactarate and D-glucarate utilization clusters contains a conserved transcriptional regulators from either GntR or IclR family, and we suggest them as a specific regulators of these pathways.\r\n\r\nGarR reductase converting tartronate semialdehyde to D-glycerate is more common and may be involved in other metabolic pathways like Allantoin and purines catabolism, tartrate catabolism and others.\r\n--\r\nBased on the system of Rodionov, but noting that D-glycerate kinase phosphorylates the 2 position.\r\n\r\n\r\n"],

        "description":"Glycogen is a storage polysaccharide in the majority of animal, fungal, bacterial, and archaebacterial species. Eukaryotes make glycogen from UDP-glucose, whereas most bacteria synthesize their storage polysaccharide from ADP-glucose.  These constitute two very different pathways with distinct regulatory mechanisms and rate controlling steps.  Only the latter pathway is considered in this Subsystem (Preiss, 1984).\r\n\r\nIn free-living bacteria and in mildly parasitic pathogenic bacteria, the presence of glycogen is associated with a minimum of one Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (GAT), one glycogen synthase (GS), one glycogen phosphorylase (GP), one branching enzyme (GBr), and one debranching enzyme (GdBr), often organized in one or two operons (Ball, Morell, 2003).  Aside from this core pathway of glycogen metabolism, enzymes of malto-oligosaccharide utilization are considered relevant to glycogen metabolism (they are encoded in Subsystem: Maltose_and_Maltodextrin_Utilization). Indeed, malto-oligosaccharides are bound to be produced through the action of debranching enzyme during glycogen catabolism.  These malto-oligosaccharides can be processed through a combination of alpha-1,4 glucanotransferases, maltodextrin-phosphorylases, and glucosidases.  In addition to this, some bacteria contain a cytosolic alpha-amylase whose function in glycogen metabolism remains unclear (Raha et al., 1992).  These �accessory functions\" of glycogen metabolism are not included in this Subsystem. \r\n",

        "description":" Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major surface molecule of Gram-negative bacteria and consists of three distinct structural domains: O-antigen, core, and lipid A. \n The lipid A (endotoxin) domain of LPS is a unique, glucosamine-based phospholipid that serves as the hydrophobic anchor of LPS and is the bioactive component of the molecule that is associated with Gram-negative septic shock. The structural genes encoding the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of Escherchia coli lipid A have been identified and characterized. Lipid A is often viewed as a constitutively synthesized structural molecule.\n  Escherichia coli lipid A is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane by a conserved pathway of nine constitutive enzymes. Following attachment of the core oligosaccharide, nascent core-lipid A is flipped to the outer surface of the inner membrane by the ABC transporter MsbA, where the O-antigen polymer is attached. Diverse covalent modifications of the lipid A moiety may occur during its transit from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer membrane.

        "notes":["=======OBSERVATIONS:===================================================================\n\nGene lpxH � missing in the whole group of Gram-negative bacteria producing Lipid A ( variant 1.1): \nall Campylobacter sp.,\nall Helicobacter sp.,\nWolinella succinogenes DSM,\nMesorhizobium sp.,\nall Rickettsia sp.,\nRhodobacter sphaeroides,\nall Chlamydophila sp.\n\n=====OVERVIEW:====================================================================\n\nIn Escherichia coli, lipid A consists of a beta -1',6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is phosphorylated at the 1- and 4'-positions and is substituted at the 2-, 3-, 2'-, and 3'-positions with (R)-3-hydroxymyristate chains. It is further acylated with laurate and myristate via acyloxyacyl linkages to the (R)-3-hydroxymyristoyl groups of the distal sugar (see diagram in ref.2). The minimal LPS required for E. coli growth consists of Kdo2-lipid A, the biosynthesis of which requires nine enzymes.\n Three enzymes, LpxA, LpxC, and LpxD, are required to make UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine. The pyrophosphate bond of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is then cleaved by LpxH to generate UMP and 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate. Another UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine molecule and 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate condense to form a beta,1'-6-linked disaccharide 1-phosphate (DS-1-P), with release of UDP from UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine. Disaccharide 1-phosphate is converted to Kdo2-lipid A by LpxK, WaaA(KdtA), LpxL(HtrB), and LpxM(MsbB).\n\n The nine enzymes of the constitutive Kdo2-lipid A pathway and the single-copy genes encoding them  are conserved in most gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli. The Sphingomonads, which make bioactive sphingolipids instead of Kdo2-lipid A, are some of the exceptions. The sequences of the Kdo2-lipid A genes are easily recognized when gram-negative genomes are compared. LpxA, -C, and -D are soluble proteins, whereas LpxB and LpxH are peripheral membrane proteins. LpxK, KdtA, LpxL, and LpxM are integral inner membrane proteins. Their active sites are presumed to face the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane, given that their water-soluble cosubstrates are cytoplasmic molecules.\n\n Interestingly, key genes for lipid A biosynthesis have unexpectedly also been found in higher plants, indicating that eukaryotic lipid A-like molecules may exist.\n\n=====MISSING: Gene lpxH - mysterious fourth step of Kdo2 � lipid A biosynthesis=============\n\n The  most mysterious is the fourth step of Kdo2 � lipid A biosynthesis which is catalyzed by the enzyme LpxH.\n LpxH cleaves the pyrophosphate bond of the UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine intermediate, the precursor of the nonreducing sugar of lipid A, yielding UMP and 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (lipid X) ( ref.4 ). The lpxH gene was the last of the structural genes of the nine enzymatic steps to be discovered. In contrast with the key structural genes in the lipid A pathway, clear orthologs of lpxH are only found in approximately 50% of the Gram-negative organisms sequenced to date. Although more distant homologs designated lpxH2 can be found in other Gram-negative bacteria: C. crescentus, Mesorhizobium loti, S. meliloti, they may not have the same function, as it was shown for lpxH2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ref.5).\n\nClearly, bacteria lacking LpxH contain an unidentified UDP-2,3-diacylglucoasamine-specific pyrophosphatase.\n\nOBSERVATION: There is a protein of unknown function DUF1009 present in very strong cluster with all lipid A biosynthesis genes in many genomes missing LpxH and possibly it's a candidate for LpxH function (see variant 1.12)? The counterargument is the lack of homology with any known phosphohydrolases. Another possibility is an alternative chemistry in these organisms.\n\n  Although most Gram-negative bacteria contain LpxH or DUF1009 orthologs, at least seven organisms appear to lack both proteins: Aquifex aeolicus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp.\n\n-----------EXPORT OF NEWLY SYNTHESIZED LPS AND PHOSPHOLIPIDS:----------------------\n\n\n======REFERENCES:==========================\n\n1.

PMID: 28791878\nRole of Ergothioneine in Microbial Physiology and Pathogenesis.\nCumming BM, Chinta KC, Reddy VP, Steyn AJC\n\nSIGNIFICANCE:\nL-ergothioneine is synthesized in actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, methylobacteria, and some fungi. In contrast to other low-molecular-weight redox buffers, glutathione and mycothiol, ergothioneine is primarily present as a thione rather than a thiol at physiological pH, which makes it resistant to autoxidation. Ergothioneine regulates microbial physiology and enables the survival of microbes under stressful conditions encountered in their natural environments. In particular, ergothioneine enables pathogenic microbes, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), to withstand hostile environments within the host to establish infection. Recent Advances: Ergothioneine has been reported to maintain bioenergetic homeostasis in Mtb and protect Mtb against oxidative stresses, thereby enhancing the virulence of Mtb in a mouse model. Furthermore, ergothioneine augments the resistance of Mtb to current frontline anti-TB drugs. Recently, an opportunistic fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, which infects immunocompromised individuals, has been found to produce ergothioneine, which is important in conidial health and germination, and contributes to the fungal resistance against redox stresses.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES:\nThe molecular mechanisms of the functions of ergothioneine in microbial physiology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. It is currently not known if ergothioneine is used in detoxification or antioxidant enzymatic pathways. As ergothioneine is involved in bioenergetic and redox homeostasis and antibiotic susceptibility of Mtb, it is of utmost importance to advance our understanding of these mechanisms.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS:\nA clear understanding of the role of ergothioneine in microbes will advance our knowledge of how this thione enhances microbial virulence and resistance to the host's defense mechanisms to avoid complete eradication.

Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) synthetase (an activity of the non-discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) is the first step in the indirect charging of tRNA(Asn).\r\n2-4.  Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase subunit A, B and C are the \"bacterial\" second step of the indirect charging of tRNA(Asn).  See note above about \"bacterial\" Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase.  (The fact that no archaeon seems to have lost the heterodimeric Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase, even when the have Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase, suggests that this latter enzyme is not fully funcitonal as a Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase in Archaea.)\r\n5. Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because the non-discriminating form of the enzyme is essential to the pathway.\r\n6. Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because it makes the indirect pathway optional.\r\n7. Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because its absence makes the amidotransferase essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAmong Bacteria, the GatCAB heterotrimeric enzyme seems to have both Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase and Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase activities, even if there is no non-discriminating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.  This can be used for amino acid biosynthesis, not just tRNA charging.  (The original paper describing indirect charging in Bacillis subtilis called it a biosynthetic pathway. [Wilcox, M, and Nirenberg, M.  1968.  Transfer RNA as a cofactor coupling amino acid synthesis with that of protein.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 61: 229-326; also note Griffiths, E, and Bayley, S. T.  1969.  Properties of transfer ribonucleic acid and aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases from an extremely halophilic bacterium.  Biochemistry 8: 541-551].)\r\n\r\nThe assignments to eukaryotic Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit C is a guess based on extensive PSI-BLAST searches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinguishing the \"discriminating\" and \"non-discriminating\" Glu-tRNA(Glu) and Asp-tRNA(Asp) synthetases is imprecise (to put it mildly).  In principle, having a non-discriminating synthetase, without the amidotransferase is lethal, as it makes \"mischarged\" tRNA, but does not convert it to the correct amino acid.  Because a non-discriminating synthetase really has two activities, that is how I am annotating them:\r\n\r\n   Discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12)\r\n   Non-discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12); Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) synthetase\r\n   Discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17)\r\n   Non-discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17); Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) synthetase\r\n\r\nFor the time being, assignment to non-discriminating type has been very conservative, in most cases, only when no direct charging enzyme is present, and there is strong evidence for the appropriate amidotransferase.  The problem is that there are a remarkable number of genomes in which there are two Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase genes, at least one of which must be non-discriminating, but there is no obvious criterion for choosing which.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganellar enzymes have not been distinguished.  Mitochondtria and chloroplasts mostly use the indirect charging of tRNA(Gln), and direct charging of tRNA(Asn).\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganism-specific notes:\r\n\r\nAsnRS\r\nArabidopsis AsnRS is not evident\r\n\r\n###############################\r\nLITERATURE\r\n"],

        "description":"The TonB system (TonB/ExbB/ExbD) transduces the protonmotive force (pmf) of the cytoplasmic membrane to the outer membrane to provide energy for a number of TonB-dependent transporters and TonB-dependent trans-envelope signalling systems.  \r\n\r\nTonB-dependent transporters are bacterial outer membrane proteins that bind and transport siderophores (ferric chelates), as well as vitamin B(12), nickel complexes, and carbohydrates. The transport process requires energy in the form of proton motive force and a complex of three inner membrane proteins, TonB-ExbB-ExbD to transduce this energy to the outer membrane (PMID: 20420522)\r\n\r\nTonB-dependent regulatory systems consist of six components:\r\n- a specialized outer membrane-localized receptor (TonB-dependent transducer),\r\n- a cytoplasmic membrane-localized anti-sigma factor and \r\n- an extracytoplasmic function (ECF)-subfamily sigma factor. \r\nThis sophisticated complex senses signals from outside the bacterial cell and transmits them via two membranes into the cytoplasm, leading to transcriptional activation of target genes. TonB-dependent transducers might be important for pathogenicity (PMID:15993072)\r\n",

It is likely that polyamines were present in the last universal common ancestor and can be considered as part of the minimal metabolome in extant cells. Polyamines are important for cell proliferation, growth, and development, and triamines, such as spermidine, are thought to bind to RNA and influence ribosome function. Eukaryotic and archaeal cells use spermidine as the aminobutyl donor for the biosynthesis of the unique and essential amino acid hypusine found only in translation initiation factor 5A. In addition to core physiological roles, polyamines in bacteria are also involved in siderophore biosynthesis, swarming, and biofilm formation. Norspermidine[3,3'-diaminodipropylamine]\r\n\n",

It is not clear how GSH redox homeostatsis is maintained. Nonorthologous GSH reductase (\"missing\" gene) is present?? Alternatively - in at least one of such organisms, Synechocystis 6803, Thioredoxin reductase (TR) was shown to use glutaredoxin (Grx) as an electron donor in a novel integrative pathway NADPH-TR-Grx1-Grx2-Ferredoxin (Marteyn et al., 2008)\n\nVariant code 9 is assigned to organisms where NO GSH biosynthesis can be asserted, but homolog(s) of GSH-dependent enzyme(s) appear present.  An assumption that these enzymes are merely an overannotation is one likely explanation.  However, a contradicting example can be found in the genera Haemophilus and Streptococcus, where only a few species contain �Glutathione biosynthesis bifunctional protein gshF�, but ALL sequenced genomes appear to contain an GSH reductase ortholog. For a fascinating discussion of patchy occurrence profile of �Glutathione biosynthesis bifunctional protein gshF� see (Gopal et al., 2005).  An apparent presence of the GSH reductase in the absence of GshF (or the common GSH biosynthesis pathway) might be due to utilization of EXOGENOUS GSH in defense against oxidative stress, as it has been reported in Haemophilus influenzae, for example, (Vergauwen et al., 2003).\n"],

        "description":"Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly), which is present in high concentration in most living cells from microorganisms to man.  The biological importance of GSH is mainly related to the free sulphydryl moiety of Cys residue. Which confers unique redox (Eo= -0.24) and nucleophilic properties.  GSH servers a pivotal role in numerous and very diverse cellular functions, including free radical scavenging, redox reactions, formation of deoxyribonucleotides, detoxication of xenobiotics, amino acid transport and leukotriene biosynthesis (in eukaryotes), and many others.   Main forms of GSH include: \n(i)\treduced GSH, \n(ii)\toxidized GSSG and \n(iii)\tmixed disulfides: mostly GSS-protein and GSSR (R =  suitable residue such as cysteine or CoASH).  For example, CoASSG is a major component of the CoA pool in yeast and E. coli (Loewen 1981)\n(iv)\tthiol esters, which function as intermediates in metabolism of certain compounds, such as methylglyoxal and formaldehyde\n\nUnder unstressed physiological conditions much of the thipeptide is present in the free reduced form.  In E. coli GSH content is very high and accounts for more than 1% of dry cell weight.  The concentration of oxidized form is usually much smaller, with the GSH/GSSG ratio generally being greater than 50.  This balance is maintained by GSH reductase (at the expense of NADPH), ensuring a cellular environment where essential sulphygryl groups of key enzymes and co-enzymes are protected.  The opposite conversion of GSH to GSSH can be catalyzed by:\n- GSH peroxidase, which eliminates H2O2 and organic peroxides\n- GSH transhydrogenases - a group of enzymes involved in thiol-disulphide exchanges (protein disulphide isomerase, thiol-transferase, thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase).  The majority of these activities have not been associated with any sequences yet, and are not encoded in this SS\n- or be caused by non-enzymic processes\n\nGSH-related enzymes can be grouped into those concerned with:\n\n- biosynthesis and degradation (encoded in SS: �Glutathione: gamma-glutamyl cycle�)\n- reduction and oxidation (encoded in this SS)\n- conjugation and those in which GSH serves as a cofactor (encoded in SS: �Glutathione: Non-redox reactions�, �Glutathione-dependent pathway of formaldehyde detoxification�, and others)\n\nReferences\n\nPenninckx MJ, Elskens MT.  1993.

My interpretation is: the ancestral state was three paralogs represented by ehaP, ehaP3 and ehaU.  All modern lineages contain ehaU.  In Methanothermobacter, the ehaP3 paralog was lost and replaced by a duplication of ehaP.  In Methanopyrus, the ehaP was inherited unchanged.  In addition, the C-terminal of ehaP3 was lost and replaced by a new gene derived from the C-terminal of ehaP (which I called ehaP2).  For Methanococcus and Methanocaldococcus, the ehaP3 paralog was inherited intact.  However, the N-terminal portion of ehaP paralog was lost, forming a ehaP2 homolog.  \r\n\r\n"],

        "description":"Plant J. 2008 Sep 11. [Epub ahead of print]\r\nA conserved mechanism for nitrile metabolism in bacteria and plants.\r\nHowden AJ, Jill Harrison C, Preston GM.\r\nDepartment of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3RB, UK.\r\n\r\nPseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 is a plant growth-promoting bacterium that efficiently colonises the leaf surfaces and rhizosphere of a range of plants. Previous studies have identified a putative plant-induced nitrilase gene (pinA) in P. fluorescens SBW25 that is expressed in the rhizosphere of sugar beet plants. Nitrilase enzymes have been characterised in plants, bacteria and fungi and are thought to be important in nitrile detoxification, nitrogen utilisation and plant hormone synthesis. We reveal that pinA is a NIT4-type nitrilase that catalyses the hydrolysis of beta-cyano-L-alanine, a nitrile common in the plant environment and an intermediate in the plant cyanide detoxification pathway. In plants cyanide is converted to beta-cyano-L-alanine, which is subsequently detoxified to aspartic acid and ammonia by NIT4. In P. fluorescens SBW25 pinA is induced in the presence of beta-cyano-L-alanine, and the beta-cyano-L-alanine precursors cyanide and cysteine. pinA allows P. fluorescens SBW25 to use beta-cyano-L-alanine as a nitrogen source and to tolerate toxic concentrations of this nitrile. In addition, pinA is shown to complement a NIT4 mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana, enabling plants to grow in concentrations of beta-cyano-L-alanine that would otherwise prove lethal. Interestingly, over-expression of pinA in wild-type A. thaliana not only resulted in increased growth in high concentrations of beta-cyano-L-alanine, but also resulted in increased root elongation in the absence of exogenous beta-cyano-L-alanine, demonstrating that beta-cyano-L-alanine nitrilase activity can have a significant effect on root physiology and root development.\r\n",

        "description":"Cell death in bacteria can be triggered by activation of self-inflicted molecular mechanisms. Pathogenic bacteria often make use of suicide mechanisms in which the death of individual cells benefits survival of the population. Important elements for programmed cell death in bacteria are proteinaceous toxin-antitoxin systems. While the toxin generally resides dormant in the bacterial cytosol in complex with its antitoxin, conditions such as impaired de novo synthesis of the antitoxin or nutritional stress lead to antitoxin degradation and toxin activation. A widespread toxin-antitoxin family consists of the Epsilon/Zeta systems, which are distributed over plasmids and chromosomes of various pathogenic bacteria. In its inactive state, the bacteriotoxic Zeta toxin protein is inhibited by its cognate antitoxin Epsilon. Upon degradation of Epsilon, the Zeta toxin is released allowing this enzyme to poison bacterial cell wall synthesis, which eventually triggers autolysis. Epsilon/Zeta systems ensure stable plasmid inheritance by inducing death in plasmid-deprived offspring cells. In contrast, chromosomally encoded Epsilon/Zeta systems were reported to contribute to virulence of pathogenic bacteria, possibly by inducing autolysis in individual cells under stressful conditions. The capability of toxin-antitoxin systems to kill bacteria has made them potential targets for new therapeutic compounds.\nZeta toxins phosphorylate the ubiquitous peptidoglycan precursor uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) and this activity is counteracted by binding of antitoxin Epsilon.\n",

Chromate (CrO4  2&#8722;) exerts diverse toxic effects on bacteria, including inhibition of transport of the essential analog sulfate, as well as DNA and protein damage after intracellular reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Mechanisms of resistance to chromium compounds include membrane transporters, encoded by the chrA genes, which directly mediate efflux of chromate ions from the cell�s cytoplasm, as well as detoxification reactions.\r\n\r\nTranscription of chrB, chrA and chrC is induced by chromate.\r\n\r\nChrB is a chromate-sensing regulator of chr expression. Inactivation of chrB led to a complete loss of chromate resistance. Although ChrB contains a hydrophobic amino acid stretch at the amino terminus which could be a leader sequence, the protein appears not to be exported into the periplasm; thus, ChrB may not be a periplasmic protein.\r\n\r\nChrA is a membrane-bound protein responsible for chromate efflux. Deletion of chrA led to a complete loss of chromate resistance.\r\n\r\nChrF might be a repressor for chromate-dependent induction of chrB.\r\n\r\nChrE shows sequence similarity to a rhodanese that has been proposed to clear off seleno-glutathione-complexes that are formed by the reaction of selenite with glutathione (Self et al. 2000). Since chromate interacts with glutathione (Arslan et al. 1987; Debetto et al. 1988), ChrE may cleave some chromium-glutathione-complexes.\r\n\r\nThe chrC gene directly downstream of chrA encodes a protein homologous to manganese- or iron-SODs. Deletion of chrC resulted in a significant and reproducible loss of 1/7 or 1/8 of chromate resistance. ChrC protein might scavenge superoxide radicals that originate when chromate interacts with cellular compounds.\r\n\r\nDeletion of chrI upstream of chrB1 led to a decrease in chromate resistance.\r\n"],

At some stage, the arabinofuranose units are added, donated not by a nucleotide sugar but a lipid carrier, C50-P-Ara.  \nTwo galactosyl transferases can apparently account for the full biosynthesis of the cell wall galactan of mycobacteria:  galactofuranosyl transferase GlfT1 is involved in the initial steps of galactan formation and is responsible for attaching the first and, perhaps, the second Galf unit to the C50-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha acceptor.  Another galactosyl transferase, GlfT2 (bifunctional) is responsible for the formation of the bulk of the galactan, containing alternating 5- and 6-linked beta-Galf units (Belanova et al., 2008)\n\nDprE1 and DprE2 are involved in the biosynthesis of D-arabinose and, in particular, they are essential to perform the transformation of decaprenylphosphoryl-D-ribose to decaprenylphosphoryl-D-arabinose, which is a substrate for arabinosyltransferases in the synthesis of the cell-envelope arabinogalactan and liporabinomannan polysaccharides of mycobacteria (Belanova et al., 2008)\n\n",

        "description":"Quorum sensing depends on extracellular cell�cell signaling molecules. In Gram-negative bacteria, these signals are derived from acylated homoserine lactones. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria predominately use peptides. Bacillus subtilis and its closest relatives have multiple rap-phr quorum sensing gene pairs that coordinate a variety of physiological processes with population density. \r\n\r\nRap proteins, originally named for their function as regulators of aspartate phosphatases (Perego et al., 1994), influence Spo0A activity by modulating the sporulation phosphorelay system. Specifically, the chromosomally encoded Rap proteins (RapA, B, E, H, I and J) act as phosphatases of Spo0F~P.  Rap protein activity is coordinated with population density via extracellular Phr signaling peptides.  Phr peptides are synthesized as precursor proteins, pro-Phr, containing an N-terminal signal sequence that is required for export into the extracellular environment by the SecA pathway (Pottathil and Lazazzera, 2003; Stephenson et al., 2003). Once outside the cell, extracellular proteases Subtilisin, Vpr and Epr, process the Phr precursor into the mature signaling peptide (Lanigan-Gerdes et al., 2007). Mature Phr peptides reenter cells through the oligopeptide permease Opp (LeDeaux et al., 1997), and once inside the cell, Phr peptides bind to and inhibit the activity of their cognate Rap proteins\r\n\r\nNotably, rap-phr genes can also present on mobile genetic elements, e.g. Rap60-Phr60 from plasmid pTA1060 was shown to coordinate a variety of biological processes with population density including sporulation, cannibalism, biofilm formation and genetic competence (PMID:25598361)\r\n\r\nThe two founding members of the Phr family of extracellular signaling peptides are the PhrA peptide (sequence: ARNQT) and CSF (PhrC) of B. subtilis. CSF was identified as a five amino acid peptide (sequence: ERGMT) present in the culture supernatants that stimulated the activity of a transcription factor ComA required for genetic competence development (PMID: 8769645) \r\n",

Mutant M7 defective in the devA gene is arrested in the development of heterocysts at an early stage and is not able to fix N2 under aerobic conditions. The devA gene is differentially expressed in heterocysts. To gain a better understanding of the structural components of this putative ABC transporter, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the entire gene cluster. The two additional genes, named devB and devC, encode proteins with similarities to membrane fusion proteins (DevB) of several ABC exporters and to membrane-spanning proteins (DevC) of ABC transporters in general. Site-directed mutations in each of the three genes resulted in identical phenotypes. Heterocyst-specific glycolipids forming the laminated layer of the envelope were identified in lipid extracts of M7 and in the site-directed mutants. However, transmission electron microscopy revealed unequivocally that the glycolipid layer is missing in mutant M7. Ultrastructural analysis also confirmed a developmental block at an early stage of differentiation. The results of this study suggest that the devBCA operon encodes an exporter of glycolipids or of an enzyme that is necessary for the formation of the laminated layer. The hypothesis is proposed that an intact envelope could be required for further heterocyst differentiation.\r\n"],

Turns out, M.J. Pallen (7) has made similar observation before and even traced the cluster to ESAT-6 proteins and cognate secretion system in Mycobacteria. Pity, we were late! \r\n\r\nSee also related SS: ESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Actinobacteria\r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n 1 = \"minimal cluster\" of ESAT-6-like protein EsxA and FtsK/SpoIIIE family protein EssC\r\n 2 = \"full length\" cluster: EsxA and EssC, plus EssA, EssB, EsaA, and EsaB\r\n 3 = \"full length\" cluster with additional concerved components\r\n-1 = genome does not contain [ESAT-6-like + FtsK/SpoIIIE family protein]-related clusters\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen (9), is the prototype of a novel Esat-6/Esx family of small proteins of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms, many of them pathogenic (4, 7, 10).  The biochemical function of these proteins is still unclear, but their prominent role in virulence has been documented in Mycobacteria (reviewed in 1) and recently � in Staphylococcus aureus (3).  \r\nAll ESAT-6 family proteins lack known secretion signals, and their export requires novel secretory apparatus, which is encoded by a cluster of genes co-localized with ESAT-6 family proteins.  It was originally identified by bioinformatics analysis (4, 10) and later experimentally confirmed (reviewed in 2).  The genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and other Mycobacterial species has five copies of this cluster known as the ESAT-6 loci, with the region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) believed to be ancestral (5).  Orthologs of region 4 are also found in genomes of Corynebacteria, Streptomyces, Brevibacterium, and other Actinobacteria (5).\r\nConservative gene clusters encoding proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative cognate secretion system have been identified in genomes of other Gram-positive pathogens as well as, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, and Listeria monocytogenes (7).  Although the level of sequence similarity between mycobacterial ESAT-6 homologs and their analogs in Firmicutes (EssxAB/YukE proteins) is very low, their inclusion in a single ESAT-6 superfamily is based on (i) conservation of the WXG motif, (ii) the protein length of ~100 AA, and � most importantly -- (iii) a tendency of the corresponding genes to cluster with other ESAT-6 family members as well as with EssC/YukA proteins � membrane-bound ATPases possessing two or more FtsK/SpoIIIE domains (7).  Single copies of this domain, containing ATP_binding motif, are found in the FtsK cell division protein from E. coli and in the SpoIIIE  sporulation protein from B. subtilis, where they  are thought to be involved in DNA  translocation.  However, this domain is a specific example of the more general  AAA+ domain (6), common to many ATPases involved in macromolecular  secretion, including those from Gram-negative type IV protein secretion  systems (7). \r\nThe clustering of the ESAT-6 and the FtsK/SpoIIIE family proteins (the �minimal ESAT-6 cluster�), preserved almost invariably in all species (i) gives credibility to categorizing the distant ESAT-6 homologs as one family and (ii) identifies the FtsK/SpoIIIE family as the most conserved (and likely most important) component of the cognate secretion system (7).  Indeed, the essential role of the FtsK/SpoIIIE family proteins in the secretion of ESAT-6-homologs (and in virulence) has been demonstrated experimentally in Mycobacteria (reviewed in 2) and in S. aureus (3).  Notably, other genes within the ESAT-6 cluster differ between mycobacteria (see SS: �ESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Actinobacteria�) and Firmicutes (see SS: �ESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes�), yet their involvement in ESAT-6 secretion has been documented in each system (2, 3).  The differences between the components of this novel Gram(+) secretion system in diverse species may indicate adaptations to different effector molecules.  Extending a parallel with Gram(-) secretion, where secreted proteins are often components rather then targets of the translocation system, M. J. Pallen (7) has speculated that ESAT-6 family proteins are indeed a part of secretory apparatus, while effector proteins (or other macromolecules) remain to be identified and might in fact differ greatly between species.  Notably, mutations in ESAT-6 cluster in M. smegmatis not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (11).  Furthermore, the YueB protein, a B. subtilis homolog of the �putative secretion accessory protein EsaA� has been identified as the bacteriophage SPP1 receptor (8), leading the authors to speculate that membrane products of the ESAT-6 operon (YueB, YukC, and YukA) �could form a complex required for channeling the ejected DNA through the membrane.\"\r\n\r\nGiven its role in pathogenesis, it is noteworthy that the ESAT-6 secretion system also functions in non-pathogenic Mycobacteria, Clostridia, and other species.  While the function of this secretion system is likely to be different in various bacteria, conservation of the gene cluster suggests that the core mechanism of this novel Gram(+) secretion system is largely conserved. \r\n\r\n\r\nOpen problems, conjectures:\r\n\r\nI.  Several lines of evidence suggest that ESAT-6 protein family are not the actual effectors (or at least not the only effectors) of this secretion system (7).   It is tempting to speculate that large hypothetical proteins with clear amino-terminal similarity to ESAT-6 identified in B. anthracis (7) can potentially be secreted via this system.  We believe that this hypothesis can be supported be the following observations:\r\n\r\n(i)\tOne of B. anthracis large proteins with amino-terminal similarity to ESAT-6 is located immediately downstream of the ESAT-6 gene cluster in several strains (BA2198 homologs)\r\n(ii)\tDistant homologs of BA2198 are co-localized with ESAT-6 cluster in genomes of Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus as well (Fig. 1, green arrows). These proteins display distant similarity with binary ADP-ribosylating toxins of Bacillus and Clostridia (Ran Nir-Paz, personal communication), indicating their potential involvement in virulence (currently annotated in SEED as �Lmo0066 homolog within ESAT-6 gene cluster, similarity to ADP-ribosylating toxins�)\r\n(iii)\tAlthough N-termini of these Listeria and Staphylococcal proteins do not posses explicit similarity with the ESAT-6 family, the do contain the characteristic WXG motif. \r\n\r\nII.  An observation:  the presence of species-specific tandem arrays of homologous proteins in the vicinity of the ESAT-6 secretion cluster -- is a recurrent theme in genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Clostridium acetobutilicum:\r\n(i)\tDifferent strains of S. aureus contain from 6 to 11 copies of ~160 AA hypothetical ORF (DUF600)\r\n(ii)\tDifferent strains of Listeria harbor from none to 3 copies of �Lmo0066 homolog within ESAT-6 gene cluster, similarity to ADP-ribosylating toxins�\r\n(iii)\tIn Clostridium acetobutilicum up to 3 copies of a TPR-repeat-containing protein (cd00189) are present in various strains near the minimum [ESAT-6-like protein -- FtsK/SpoIIIE family protein] cluster (tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat domains are present in various chaperone, cell-cycle, transciption, and protein transport complexes and are believed to be involved in protein-protein interaction\r\nThese proteins might be a part of the secretion apparatus or it�s potential effectors. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n1.

Santos\r\n\r\nThe results reported here have identified yueB as the essential gene involved in irreversible binding of bacteriophage SPP1 to Bacillus subtilis. First, a deletion in an SPP1-resistant (pha-2) strain, covering most of the yueB gene, could be complemented by a xylose-inducible copy of yueB inserted at amyE. Second, disruption of yueB by insertion of a pMutin4 derivative resulted in a phage resistance phenotype regardless of the presence or absence of IPTG (isopropyl-&#946;-d-thiogalactopyranoside). YueB homologues are widely distributed in gram-positive bacteria. The protein Pip, which also serves as a phage receptor in Lactococcus lactis, belongs to the same family. yueB encodes a membrane protein of &#8764;120 kDa, detected in immunoblots together with smaller forms that may be processed products arising from cleavage of its long extracellular domain. Insertional inactivation of yueB and the surrounding genes indicated that yueB is part of an operon which includes at least the upstream genes yukE, yukD, yukC, and yukBA. Disruption of each of the genes in the operon allowed efficient irreversible adsorption, provided that yueB expression was retained. Under these conditions, however, smaller plaques were produced, a phenotype which was particularly noticeable in yukE mutant strains. Interestingly, such reduction in plaque size was not correlated with a decreased adsorption rate. Overall, these results provide the first demonstration of a membrane-bound protein acting as a phage receptor in B. subtilis and suggest an additional involvement of the yukE operon in a step subsequent to irreversible adsorption.\r\n\r\n================\r\n\r\n\r\nIN STAPH:\r\n\r\nSIG1  = EsxA\r\nSIG2  = EsaA\r\nSIG3  = EssB\r\nNSIG1 = EssC\r\nCONS3 = EsaB\r\nCONS4 = EssA\r\n\r\nEsxA and EsxB are secreted by an ESAT-6-like system that is required for the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infections.\r\n\r\nBurts ML, Williams WA, DeBord K, Missiakas DM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Microbiology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.\r\n\r\nMycobacterium tuberculosis secretes ESAT-6, a virulence factor that triggers cell-mediated immune responses and IFN-gamma production during tuberculosis. ESAT-6 is transported across the bacterial envelope by a specialized secretion system with a FSD (FtsK-SpoIIIE domain) membrane protein. Although the presence of ESAT-6-like genes has been identified in the genomes of other microbes, the possibility that they may encode general virulence functions has hitherto not been addressed. Herein we show that the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus secretes EsxA and EsxB, ESAT-6-like proteins, across the bacterial envelope. Staphylococcal esxA and esxB are clustered with six other genes and some of these are required for synthesis or secretion of EsxA and EsxB. Mutants that failed to secrete EsxA and EsxB displayed defects in the pathogenesis of S. aureus murine abscesses, suggesting that this specialized secretion system may be a general strategy of human bacterial pathogenesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"]},

In many (or all) cases, the same proteins constitute Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase, the second step in the indirect charging of tRNA(Asn).\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit F (EC 6.3.5.7) is a distant homolog of GatC and performs the same role in fungal mitochondria.\r\n\r\nGlutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because it makes the indirect pathway optional.\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because the non-discriminating form of the enzyme is essential to the pathway.\r\n\r\nAsparaginyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because its absence makes the transamidase essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAmong Bacteria, the GatCAB heterotrimeric enzyme seems to have both Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase and Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase activities, even if there is no non-discriminating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.  This can be used for amino acid biosynthesis, not just tRNA charging.  (The original paper describing indirect charging in Bacillis subtilis called it a biosynthetic pathway. [Wilcox, M, and Nirenberg, M.  1968.  Transfer RNA as a cofactor coupling amino acid synthesis with that of protein.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 61: 229-326; also note Griffiths, E, and Bayley, S. T.  1969.  Properties of transfer ribonucleic acid and aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases from an extremely halophilic bacterium.  Biochemistry 8: 541-551].)\r\n\r\nThe assignments to eukaryotic Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit C is a guess based on extensive PSI-BLAST searches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UniProt roles Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D (EC 6.3.5.-) and Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit E (EC 6.3.5.-) are misnomers taken from the gene names (gatD and gatE).  These two proteins make a heterodimeric, glutamine-specific amidotransferase.  [Feng, L., Sheppard, K., Tumbula-Hansen, D., and Soll, D.  2004.  Gln-tRNAGln formation from Glu-tRNAGln requires cooperation of an asparaginase and a Glu-tRNAGln kinase.  J. Biol. Chem. Dec 16; [Epub ahead of print] ]\r\n\r\nSo, the nomenclature used here is:\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase L-asparaginase subunit (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n= UniProt Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase transferase subunit (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n= UniProt Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit E (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinguishing the \"discriminating\" and \"non-discriminating\" Glu-tRNA(Glu) and Asp-tRNA(Asp) synthetases is imprecise (to put it mildly).  In principle, having a non-discriminating synthetase, without the amidotransferase is lethal, as it makes \"mischarged\" tRNA, but does not convert it to the correct amino acid.  Because a non-discriminating synthetase really has two activities, that is how I am annotating them:\r\n\r\n   Discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12)\r\n   Non-discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12); Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) synthetase\r\n   Discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17)\r\n   Non-discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17); Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) synthetase\r\n\r\nFor the time being, assignment to non-discriminating type has been very conservative, in most cases, only when no direct charging enzyme is present, and there is strong evidence for the appropriate amidotransferase.  The problem is that there are a remarkable number of genomes in which there are two Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase genes, at least one of which must be non-discriminating, but there is no obvious criterion for choosing which.\r\n\r\nSome light is shed by cases in which the \"non-discriminating\" enzyme has lost the ability to charge tRNA(Glu):\r\n\r\n   Skouloubris S, Ribas de Pouplana L, De Reuse H, Hendrickson TL.  2003.

        "description":"  L-Amino acid oxidases (L-AAOs) have been generally described as flavoproteins that oxidize amino acids releasing the corresponding ketoacid, ammonium and hydrogen peroxide. The generation of hydrogen peroxide gives to these enzymes antimicrobial characteristics. They are involved in processes such as biofilm development and microbial competition. L-AAOs are of great biotechnological interest in different applications such as the design of biosensors, biotransformations and biomedicine (PMID: 25886995)\n\n   Marinomonas mediterranea synthesizes LodA, the first known L-AAO, which contains a quinone cofactor in place of FAD. LodA has lysine-epsilon oxidase activity (EC 1.4.3.20) and catalyzes oxidative deamination of free L-lysine into 6-semialdehyde 2-aminoadipic acid, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (PMID: 17030025).  \n    Homologues to LodA have been detected in several Gram-negative bacteria (lodA and lodB operon), where they are involved in biofilm development. LodA is secreted to the external medium when the culture reaches the stationary phase. LodB, on the other hand, has only been detected inside cells, but it is not secreted. The expression of the lysine-epsilon oxidase activity in M. mediterranea requires functional copies of both genes since mutants lacking either lodA or lodB do not show any LOD activity. The active form of LodA containing the quinonic cofactor is intracellularly generated in a process that takes place only in the presence of LodB, suggesting that the latter is involved in this process. Moreover, in the absence of one of the proteins, the stability of the partner protein is compromised leading to a marked decrease in its cellular levels (PMID: 25886995)\n   Sequence alignment of the LodA-like proteins allowed detection of conserved Cys and Trp residues that are forming part of the cysteine tryptophilquinone (CTQ) cofactor in LodA (PMID: 25886995)\n   Recently GoxA, a quinoprotein with sequence similarity to LodA but with a different enzymatic activity (glycine oxidase instead of lysine-epsilon-oxidase) has been described. \n",

However, so far the corresponding genes have been cloned and characterized for only 4 of them (cutA, cutC, cutE, and cutF).  Note, that homologs of the CorC protein are included in this SS only based on their tight clustering with CutE, their contribution to copper-resistance is not clear.\r\n       The Scs locus has been identified in S. typhimurium as a locus, which relieves the copper sensitivity of cutF, cutC, cutE, and cutA mutants of E. coli. This locus encodes four proteins, ScsA, B, C and D, and is organized into two operons, one containing only the scsA gene and the other consisting of the scsBCD genes. \r\n      The scs locus is absent in E. coli, however, copper tolerance is restored when this locus is introduced into copper-sensitive mutants of this organism.  Notably, orthologs of the cbpA and agp genes, flanking this locus in Salmonella are present on E. coli chromosome (b1001 and b1002 respectively).  Similarly patchy phylogenetic distribution of this locus is evident in other genera.  For example, it is present in a few species of Yersinia, Vibrio and Shewanella, but absent in others. \r\n      Based on the homology of Scs proteins to other known proteins, it appears that these proteins confer copper tolerance on the Cu-sensitive mutants of E. coli either directly or by affecting the folding of target proteins by catalyzing disulfide bond isomerization.  Although it seems likely that the products of these genes appear to function as disulfide bond isomerases, the actual function of these proteins remains to be established (Gupta et al., 1997).\r\n      Note, that plasmid-borne copper resistance determinants are not included in this Subsystem.

Transformants of a recBCD deletion mutant of Escherichia coli with plasmid pGV1 carrying this DNA fragment showed ATP-dependent nuclease activity. Three open reading frames were identified on the 8.8-kb SalI-SmaI fragment, which could encode three proteins with molecular masses of 135 (AddB protein), 141 (AddA protein), and 28 kDa. Only the AddB and AddA proteins are required for ATP-dependent exonuclease activity. Both the AddB and AddA proteins contained a conserved amino acid sequence for ATP binding. In the AddA protein, a number of small regions were present showing a high degree of sequence similarity with regions in the E. coli RecB protein. The AddA protein contained six conserved motifs which were also present in the E. coli helicase II (UvrD protein) and the Rep helicase, suggesting that these motifs are involved in the DNA unwinding activity of the enzyme. When linked to the T7 promoter, a high level of expression was obtained in E. coli.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 1646786\r\n"],

        "description":"This Subsystems is based on (Ozaki et al., 2013 (PMID: 23430264).  It encodes two types of putative gene clusters, both including an indole prenyltransferase IptA homolog (widely distributed among actinomycetes).  The two gene clusters, albeit very similar, differ in that one contains a tryptophanase gene (type A cluster), whereas the other contains a flavin-dependent monooxygenase gene (type B cluster)\r\n\r\nThe type A cluster was shown in Streptomyces sp. SN-593 to catalyze the biosynthesis of 6-dimethylallylindole (DMAI)-3-carbardehyde (Takahashi et al. 2010, PMID:20348259). In this biosynthetic pathway, IptA homolog catalyzes the addition of a dimethylallyl group onto the C-6 position of tryptophan to yield 6-dimethylallyltryptophan (DMAT).\r\n\r\nThe type B cluster [iptA homolog- and FMO-containing] in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) synthesizes a novel metabolite  5- dimethylallylindole (DMAI)-3-acetonitrile (5-DMAIAN) according to (Ozaki et al., 2013, PMID: 23430264).  In this biosynthetic pathway, the IptA homolog SCO7467 catalyzes the prenylation of L-tryptophan to form 5-dimethylallyl-L-tryptophan (5-DMAT).   SCO7468 then catalyzes the conversion of 5-DMAT into 5-dimethylallylindole-3-acetaldoxime (5-DMAIAOx).\r\n\r\nThe study of these gene clusters provides insight into the biosynthesis of novel secondary metabolites in actinomycetes, namely prenylated indole derivatives, which show diverse biological and pharmacological activities including cytotoxicity and antifungal activity (PMID: 23430264).  In addition, because the potential for prenylated indole biosynthesis is widely distributed in soil actinomycetes, the prenylated indoles might possess yet unknown and important biological activities. Particularly intriguing is the structural similarity between 2 and indole-3-acetic acid (auxin), a major plant hormone.  Recently, transkingdom signaling between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and A. thaliana was reported (PMID: 21482761).  Prenylated indoles such as 5-dimethylallylindole-3-acetonitrile might contribute to an uncharacterized signaling pathway between actinomycetes and plants in the opinion of Ozaki et al., 2013 (PMID: 23430264)\r\n\r\n",

        "description":"  Quorum sensing is a process of chemical communication that bacteria use to assess cell population density and synchronize behavior on a community-wide scale. Communication is mediated by signal molecules called autoinducers. The LuxS autoinducer synthase produces 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), the precursor to a set of interconverting molecules that are generically called autoinducer-2 (AI-2). In enteric bacteria, AI-2 production induces the assembly of a transport apparatus (called the LuxS regulated (Lsr) transporter) that internalizes endogenously produced AI-2 as well as AI-2 produced by other bacterial species.\n  AI-2 internalization is proposed to be a mechanism enteric bacteria employ to interfere with the signaling capabilities of neighboring species of bacteria. \n  Following internalization, the kinase LsrK phosphorylates carbon-5 of the open form of DPD. Phosphorylated DPD (P-DPD) binds specifically to the repressor of the lsr operon, LsrR, consistent with P-DPD being the inducer of the lsr operon. Subsequently, LsrG catalyzes the cleavage of P-DPD producing 2-phosphoglycolic acid. This series of chemical events is proposed to enable enteric bacteria to respond to the presence of competitor bacteria by sequestering and destroying AI-2, thereby eliminating the competitors' intercellular communication capabilities.\n\n In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium the rapid disappearance of AI-2 is a consequence of its import by an ABC transporter designated the Lsr transporter (luxS regulated). The lsr operon contains seven genes, lsrACDBFGE, and its transcription is activated by AI-2. The first four genes, lsrACDB, encode components of the AI-2 tr. Adjacent to, but transcribed divergently from the lsr operon is lsrR, which encodes a repressor of lsr transcription, and lsrK, which encodes a kinase that phosphorylates intracellular AI-2 following import. Phosphorylation of internalized AI-2 is required for induction of transcription of the lsr operon, suggesting that phospho-AI-2 is the inducer of this system. It is postulated that phospho-AI-2 binds to the LsrR repressor and inactivates it and that this results in derepression of lsr transcription \n\n",

        "notes":["  AI-2 was initially identified for its control of the expression of bioluminescence in the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi. Genetic and biochemical analyses of mutants defective in AI-2 production showed that AI-2 is made from S-adenosylmethionine, which is used as a methyl donor in a variety of cellular processes which yield S-adenosylhomocysteine. S-Adenosylhomocysteine is subsequently metabolized to adenine and S-ribosylhomocysteine. S-Ribosylhomocysteine is the substrate for LuxS, which cleaves it to produce homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). DPD cyclizes spontaneously and undergoes further rearrangements to form AI-2. The structure of AI-2 bound to the V. harveyi AI-2 binding protein LuxP was determined, and the results showed that V. harveyi AI-2 is a furanosyl borate diester, indicating that borate adds to the hydrated cyclized DPD molecule.\n\n  In V. harveyi, AI-2 is bound by LuxP. This signals LuxQ to become a phosphatase, leading to LuxU and LuxO dephosphorylation, which allows LuxR expression and activation of the luciferase operon. (B) Uptake of AI-2 by the Lsr ABC transporter system in E. coli and Salmonella. The lsrACDBFGE genes are transcribed as an operon, while lsrK and lsrR are transcribed divergently. Once AI-2 is bound, it is transported into the cell through the Lsr ABC transporter, phosphorylated by LsrK, and is then thought to interact with LsrR and relieve repression of the lsr operon\n\n=====REFERENCES:==========\n\n1.

We have identified an acid and phagosome regulated (aprABC) locus that is unique to the Mtb complex and whose gene expression is induced during growth in acidic environments in vitro and in macrophages. Using the aprA promoter, we generated a strain that exhibits high levels of inducible fluorescence in response to growth in acidic medium in vitro and in macrophages. aprABC expression is dependent on the two-component regulator phoPR, linking phoPR signalling to pH sensing. Deletion of the aprABC locus causes defects in gene expression that impact aggregation, intracellular growth, and the relative levels of storage and cell wall lipids. We propose a model where phoPR senses the acidic pH of the phagosome and induces aprABC expression to fine-tune processes unique for intracellular adaptation of Mtb complex bacteria.\r\n",

        "description":"Subsystem under construction\r\n\r\nQuoted from PMID: 25846333: \r\n\"...Many members of the phylum Bacteroidetes use a novel mechanism to digest and utilize polysaccharide substrates. They use cell surface proteins to partially digest the polysaccharides and actively import the resulting oligosaccharides across the outer membrane for further digestion in the periplasm (Martens et al. 2009; Salyers et al. 1996). This strategy was first identified for starch utilization by the intestinal anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and involves a series of starch utilization system (Sus) proteins (Reeves et al. 1996, 1997; Shipman et al. 1999, 2000). Enzymes such as SusG partially digest starch, the cell-surface lipoprotein SusD binds to oligosaccharides, and the porin SusC allows transport across the outer membrane. Transport is thought to be coupled to cellular energy via the TonB/ExbBD system. B. thetaiotaomicron has over 100 susC-like genes and over 100 susD-like genes, and these are almost all arranged in tandem with susC-like genes upstream of susD-like genes (Martens et al. 2009). Many of these susC/susD pairs are adjacent to other genes involved in polysaccharide utilization, and the regions are referred to as polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). susC-like and susD-like genes appear to be con- fined to members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, but they are very common within that phylum (Bauer et al. 2006; Gonzalez et al. 2008; Manfredi et al. 2011; Martens et al. 2009; McBride et al. 2009; Xie et al. 2007). Like B. thetaiotaomicron, many of these bacteria have dozens of PULs that are thought to allow them to utilize diverse substrates\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a working model of PULs proposed in PMID: 27137179:  �the SusCD proteins are key for initial starch sensing, and together promote the efficient uptake of maltooligosaccharides.  SusC and D likely inter- act frequently as the essential unit for glycan uptake, while the interactions of these proteins with SusEFG may be more dynamic.  SusEF as well as the starch-binding sites within SusG support starch binding at the cell surface through the polysaccharide capsule. The redundancy of cell surface starch-binding sites likely enhances the capture of dietary starch, and maltooligosaccharides generated by other species in the gut.  \r\n      The structure of PUL operons is not completely conserved as there are several variations of predicted starch-targeting PULs among other well-studied Bacteroides species.  In particular, the number of SusE/F homologs, and conservation of the SusG protein varies extensively.  In addition, many predicted Sus PULs do not include obvious susA or susB genes within the same operon. Notably, proteins encoded by the susC and susD genes are the most well conserved, underscoring their central function in glycan uptake\" (PMID: 27137179)\r\n\r\n",

The results of Ref.2 indicate that the citramalate-dependent pathway is the major route for isoleucine biosynthesis in G. sulfurreducens. This conclusion is supported by genetic, biochemical, and 13C-labeling data. The citramalate synthase of G. sulfurreducens represents a novel phylogenetic variant of the enzyme. \r\n\r\n=================REFERENCES:=================================================\r\n\r\n1.

        "description":"Pathogenic mycobacteria require type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport virulence factors across their complex cell envelope. These bacteria have up to five of these systems, termed ESX-1 to ESX-5. This Subsystem encodes locus ESX-5 in all Mycobacterial genomes currently available in the SEED database.\r\n\r\nESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen, is the prototype of a novel family of small proteins (ESX) of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms.  The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has 23 ESX proteins, encoded by genes esxA through esxW, arranged in tandem pairs in 11 genomic loci, known as the ESX or ESAT-6 loci \r\n\r\nExport of ESAT-6 and related proteins requires a dedicated secretory apparatus, variously named ESAT-6- , SNM-, ESX-, or type VII secretion system (Bitter et al., 2009). Components of these secretion machinery are commonly encoded by clusters of genes co-localized with the ESAT-6 (ESX) family proteins. Out of the 11 ESX loci in the genome of M. tuberculosis, five (ESX-1 through ESX-5) include secretion system components.  Among them region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) is believed to be ancestral.  Only the ESX-5 region is encoded in this SS, please see the following subsystems for loci ESX-21 through ESX-4:\r\n\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-1)\r\n    ...........\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-4)\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes\r\n\r\nConservative gene clusters containing proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative secretion system (SNM) have been identified in other Gram-positive pathogens as well, including Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diptheriae and Listeria monocytogenes (Pallen, 2002).  In Staphylococcus aureus SNM  homologues are required for secretion of ESAT-6-like proteins (Burts et al ., 2005).  As with mycobacteria, loss of ESAT-6 secretion in S. aureus  correlates with reduced virulence.   \r\n\r\nGiven its role in pathogenesis, it is curious that the ESAT-6/Esx/SNM secretion system also functions in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. M. smegmatis  has a genetic locus homologous to RD1 and is able to secrete ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homologues (Gey Van Pittius et al .,2001; Converse and Cox, 2005). Interestingly, mutations in M. smegmatis SNM homologues not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (Converse and Cox, 2005), but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (Flint et al ., 2004).

Gene cluster for dissimilatory nitrite\r\nreductase (nir) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: sequencing and identification of a locus\r\nfor heme d1 biosynthesis.  J. Bacteriol. 179: 235-242.\r\n\r\nSequenced the operon nirSMCFDLGHJEN in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.\r\n\r\nGenetically demonstrated that the nirFDLGHJE genes were necessary for the biosynthesis of heme d1.\r\n\r\nNirS - Cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (EC:1.7.2.1)\r\nThis is the enzyme.  It is a homodimer.  The subunits are diheme (c and d1).\r\nIt is a periplasmic protein.\r\n\r\n\r\nNirM - Cytochrome c551 NirM\r\nPreviously annotated as cytochrome c551/552.  This can serve as the electron donor in vitro.\r\n\r\n\r\nNirC - Cytochrome c55X precursor NirC\r\nThere is evidence that this can serve as an alternative electron donor:\r\nHasegawa, N., Arai, H., and Igarashi, Y.  2001.  Two c-type cytochromes, NirM and NirC,\r\nencoded in the nir gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa act as electron donors for\r\nnitrite reductase.  Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 288: 1223-1230.\r\n\r\nNirF - Heme d1 biosynthesis protein NirF\r\nHas similarity to C-terminal 3/4 of \"Nitrite reductase associated c-type cytochorome NirN\" and\r\nto C-terminal 3/4 of \"Cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (EC:1.7.2.1)\".\r\n\r\n\r\nNirDLGH:\r\n\r\nNirD - Heme d1 biosynthesis protein NirD\r\nFused with NirL in several genomes.\r\n\r\nNirL - Heme d1 biosynthesis protein NirL\r\nFused with NirD in several genomes.\r\n\r\nNirG - Heme d1 biosynthesis protein NirG\r\n\r\nNirH - Heme d1 biosynthesis protein NirH\r\n\r\nThese 4 genes are all related, suggesting 2 duplications (the second of which\r\nduplicated 2 genes):\r\n\r\n   +-- NirD\r\n+--+\r\n|  +-- NirG\r\n+\r\n|  +-- NirL\r\n+--+\r\n   +-- NirH\r\n\r\nIn several genomes (e.g., Clostridium acetobutylicum, Syntrophus aciditrophicus, Desulfovibrio sp.,\r\nMethanosarcina sp., and Methanosaeta thermophila), there are 2 homologs, one related to NirD/NirG,\r\nand one related to NirL/NirH.  These two genes are fused in still other genomes.\r\n\r\nTheir precise functions are unknown.  They are sometimes annotated as Lrp-family transcriptional\r\nregulators.  They are essential for synthesis of heme d1.\r\n\r\n\r\nNirJ - Heme d1 biosynthesis protein NirJ\r\nSimilar to and frequently misannotated as \"Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein E\".\r\nA radial SAM protein.  Matches Fe-S oxidoreductase domains.  Other related proteins seem to be\r\ninvolved in protein maturation/derivitization.\r\n\r\n\r\nNirE - Uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107)\r\nAnnotated as \"Uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107)\".  This might not be\r\nquite right, as this enzyme is required for cytochrome d1 synthesis is Pseudomona aeruginosa,\r\nbut there does not seem to be any ortholog in some genomes with the subsystem (e.g., Hahella\r\nchejuensis and Thiobacillus denitrificans).\r\n\r\n\r\nNirN - Nitrite reductase associated c-type cytochorome NirN\r\nPreviously annoatated as \"Cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (EC:1.7.2.1)\".  In spite of sequence\r\nsimilarity to NirS, the authentic \"Cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (EC:1.7.2.1)\", there is no biochemical\r\nsupport for assigning the same function to these two proteins.\r\n\r\n\r\nThiomicrospira denitrificans seems to have a minimalist system.\r\n###############################\r\nLITERATURE\r\n"],

        "description":"Subsystem under construction \r\n\r\nTetracyclines (TET) were discovered in the 1940s and exhibited activity against a wide range of microorganisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, rickettsiae, and protozoan parasites. The first tetracycline-resistant bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae, was isolated in 1953. It was in fact the inquiry into molecular mechanisms of TET resistance that opened up the entire field of antimicrobial resitance (ISBN 1-55581-329-1) \r\n\r\nTetracycline resistance is most often due to the acquisition of new genes, which encode either (i) energy-dependent efflux of tetracyclines or (ii) a protein that protects bacterial ribosomes from the action of tetracyclines (Chopra and Roberts, 2001). Ribosomal protection proteins and TET efflux pumps are the two main mechanisms of TET resistance. In addition, a limited number of bacteria acquire resistance by mutations, which alter the permeability of the outer membrane porins and/or lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane, change the regulation of innate efflux systems, or alter the 16S rRNA.  Reviewed in (Chopra and Roberts, 2001)\r\n\r\nOver 40 types of TET resistant determinants have been described so far, and new ones are being reported. Dr. Stuart Levy from Tufts is the clearinghouse for naming new TET genes. A new gene must have <79% amino acid identity with all previous characterized TET genes to be recorded.  A detailed up-to-date database is maintained by prof. Marilyn Roberts:  http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/\r\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/tetnomenclature.pdf\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem encodes tetracycline degradation/modification enzymes.\r\nFor tetracycline resistant determinants of the ribosomal protection type see Subsystem \"Tetracycline resistance, ribosome protection type\"\r\nFor tetracycline resistant determinants of the efflux type see Subsystem \"Tetracycline resistance, efflux systems type\"\r\n",

These enzymes catalyze the synthesis of the acyl (or aryl) coenzyme A derivative in a thiamine PPi-dependent oxidative decarboxylation reaction with reduction of ferredoxin or flavodoxin. In Helicobacter pylori the major routes for the generation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and succinyl-CoA are via pyruvate:flavodoxin oxidoreductase (POR) and 2-oxoglutarate:acceptor oxidoreductase (OOR), respectively.\nThe POR of Thermococcus guaymasensis has been shown to be a bifunctional PDC/POR complex. It was predicted that all hyperthermophilic &#946; -keto acids ferredoxin oxidoreductases are bifunctional, catalyzing the activities of nonoxidative and oxidative decarboxylation of the corresponding &#946; -keto acids. \n",

M., and Haseltine, W. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 711-713).  The modified terminus must be converted to by 2'-OH for DNA repair synthesis or ligation.\r\n\r\nHenner et al. (Henner, W. D., Grunberg, S. M., and Haseltine, W. A.  1983.  Enzyme action at 3' termini of ionizing radiation-induced DNA strand breaks.  J. Biol. Chem. 258: 15198-15205) have examined this process.  The 3' phosphate can be removed by several enzymes including alkaline phosphatase.  The 3'-phosphglycolate is resistant to most DNA enzymes, including the 3'->5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity of DNA polymerase.  Exonuclease III is able to remove this damaged end, producing 2-phosphoglycolate.\r\n\r\nTeresa Pellicer et al. (Teresa Pellicer, M., Felisa Nunez, M., Aguilar, J., Badia, J., and Baldoma, L.  2003.  Role of 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase of Escherichia coli in metabolism of the 2-phosphoglycolate formed in DNA repair.  J. Bacteriol. 185: 5815-5821) have demonstrated that Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.18), the product of the gph gene, is resoponsible for this activity.  This explains the broad presence of the enzyme in organisms without a ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase.  (Did I forget to mention that 2-phosphoglycolate can also be produced from ribulose bisphosphate and molecular oxygen by ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase?)\r\n\r\n2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase is clusted with Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1) in many organisms.  It is also frequently seen near DNA repair enzymes.\r\n\r\n###############################\r\nLITERATURE\r\n"],

        "description":"This Subsystem is an attempt to discern two conserved sets of paralogous protein families based on distinct genome contexts of the corresponding genes.  It has been started by MattC and extended by SvetaG.\r\nTwo closely related operons have been described in E. coli K12:  yjf-sga and yia-sgb (Ibanez et al. 2000; Yew and Gerlt 2002).  The yjf-sga operon consists of 6 genes: sgaT, sgaB, ptxA, sgaH, sgaU, and sgaE.  The first three genes apparently encode components of a PTS sugar transporter, sgaH encodes 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase, sgaU - L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.-), and sgaE encodes L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase.  The second operon (yia-sgb) contains close homologs of sgaH, sgaU, and sgaE with gene order  preserved.  However, PTS components are missing and a sigar kinase (lyxK) is present in the same cluster.  \r\n\r\nThe yjf-sga operon has been implicated in L-ascorbate utilization in E. coli based on the fact that a knockout  mutant missing this entire gene cluster failed to ferment L-ascorbate (Yew and Gerlt 2002).  On the other hand, disruption of the yia-sgb operon did not affect fermentation of L-ascorbate (Yew and Gerlt 2002).  Specific sugar substrate of the yia-sgb catabolic operon remains unknown. \r\n",

        "notes":["Subsystem analysis allowed projection of the experimental data obtained in E.coli onto other microbial groups.  It was indeed possible to accurately identify orthologs of each of the paralogs: sgaH and sgbH, sgaU and sgbU, sgaE and sgbE in many bacterial species based of their conserved clustering on the chromosome (in spite of a high degree of sequence similarity between them).  It might also be possible to trace the evolution of these gene clusters as well (has not been attempted yet, but please note Vibrio sp. MED222 - the only genome where the 2 cliusters are next to each other forming inverted repeat!  The origin of this chromosomal douplication??). It would be very interesting to test whether or not sugar substrate for each of the two orthologous operons has remained the same in all the species.  For the time being - a few observations made during this SS encoding:\r\n\r\n1. The yjf-sga operon has counterparts in a large number of diverse microbial species within the following genera: Gamma-proteobacteria (Enterobacteriales, Vibrionales, Pasteurellales) and Firmicutes\r\n\r\n2. In addition to the 6 functionally characterized proteins (three PTS components and the SgaH, SgaU, and SgaE proteins) several uncharacterized ORFs often cluster with the yjf-sga operon:  Putative transcriptional regulators and Metal-dependent hydrolase (eco:b4192 ortholog).  The latter may be a suitable gene candidate for a �missing\" role of a hydrolase required for the L-ascorbate ring opening.  In Enterobacteriales a Putative DeoR-type transcriptional regulator is a part of the yjf-sga cluster, while Firmicutes contain a different putative regulator instead.\r\n\r\n3. Gene clusters orthogous to the yia-sgb operon are present only in Enterobacteriales and Pasteurellales (in addition to yjf-sga), and might have resulted from a relatively recent duplication event(s).\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, an interesting version of a yia-sgb-like gene cluster is present and Actinomycetales.  In Tropheryma whipplei it contains 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (EC 2.7.1.45)  in place of L-xylulose/3-keto-L-gulonate kinase � possibly indicating involvement of this operon in utilization of mucopolysaccharides, potentially an important source of carbon and energy for this obligate human pathogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n-1: no yjf-sga or yia-sgb related gene clusters are present (use \"show -1 variants\" checkbox to display these genomes)\r\n\r\nThe FIRST digit describes the presence or absence of the yjf-sga-like gene clusters:\r\n[1_] - full cluster of 8 genes is present in an organism (as in E. coli)\r\n[2_] - cluster is �incomplete�, missing one or more components\r\n[4_] - cluster appears to have split in two sub-clusters.  Several (if not all) of such variant are likely due to yet unassembled genome sequences.\r\n[9_] - cluster is missing\r\n\r\nThe SECOND digit describes the presence or absence of the yia-sgb-like gene clusters:\r\n[_1] - full cluster of 4 genes is present in an organism (as in E. coli)\r\n[_2] - cluster is �incomplete�, missing one or more of these components\r\n[_3] - a putative 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase has replaced L-xylulose/3-keto-L-gulonate kinase (as in Actinomycetales)\r\n[_4] - cluster appears to have split in two sub-clusters.  Several (if not all) of such variant are likely due to yet unassembled genome sequences.\r\n[_9] - cluster is missing\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. Although it has been reported that E. coli proteins the SgaH and SgbH exhibit sequence similarity to the D-arabino-3-hexulose 6-phosphate formaldehyde lyase (HPS) of M. aminofaciens (Reizer et al. 1997), no HPS activity could be detected for either of the sgaH and sgbH gene products in direct enzymatic assay (Yasueda et al. 1999; Taylor et al. 2004).  Furthermore, no HPS activity could be detected in extracts of E. coli cells cultured under several stresses, including formaldehyde exposure (Yasueda et al. 1999).  See SS: Formaldehyde assimilation: Ribulose monophosphate pathway\r\n\r\n2. The presence of L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.4) in the absence of all other sga or sgb genes (Variant code -1) is due to involvement of this Role also in L-Arabinose utilization (see the corresponding SS). In such cases this epimerase is often clustered with Ribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.16). The latter Role has been included in this SS as AUX to point to the presence of L-Arabinose utilization pathway in an organism.\r\n\r\n==========References:===================================\r\n\r\nCampos E, de la Riva L, Garces F, Gim�nez R, Aguilar J, Baldoma L, Badia J.

        "description":"Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly), which is present in high concentration in most living cells from microorganisms to man.  The biological importance of GSH is mainly related to the free sulphydryl moiety of Cys residue, which confers unique redox (Eo=-0.24) and nucleophilic properties.  GSH servers a pivotal role in numerous and very diverse cellular functions, including free radical scavenging, redox reactions, formation of deoxyribonucleotides, detoxication of xenobiotics, amino acid transport and leukotriene biosynthesis (in eukaryotes), and many others. Main forms of GHS include: \r\n  (i) reduced GSH, \r\n (ii) oxidized GSSG and \r\n(iii) mixed disulfides: mostly GSS-protein and GSSR (R =  suitable residue such as cysteine or CoASH).  For example, CoASSG is a major component of the CoA pool in yeast and E. coli (Loewen 1981)\r\n (iv) thiol esters, which function as intermediates in metabolism of certain compounds, such as methylglyoxal and formaldehyde\r\n  (v) another interesting derivative is the covalent addict GSH-spermidine formed at the end of exponential growth in E. coli (Tabor and Tabor, 1979) and in trypanosomatids  (encoded in Subsystem: Glutathionylspermidine and Trypanothione) \r\n\r\nUnder unstressed physiological conditions much of the thipeptide is present in the free reduced form.  In E. coli GSH content is very high and accounts for more than 1% of dry cell weight.  The concentration of oxidized form is usually much smaller, with the GSH/GSSG ratio generally being greater than 50.  This balance is maintained by GSH reductase (at the expense of NADPH), ensuring a cellular environment where essential sulphygryl groups of key enzymes and co-enzymes are protected.\r\n\r\nIn higher eukaryotes glutathione metabolism proceeds through gamma-glutamyl cycle.  Complete core cycle involves six enzymes (see Tab \"Illustrations\"): gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, GSH synthetase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase, 5-oxoprolinase, and dipeptidase (and additional peptidases in some organisms) (Meister, 1985).  However, gamma-glutamyl cycle in microbes apparently differs from that in mammals in that activities of gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferase and 5-oxoprolinase are excluded and bypassed by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.  This truncated version of the cycle involves: \r\n(i)\tthe biosynthetic enzymes (encoded also in SS: Glutathione Biosynthesis�)\r\n(ii)\tGamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, \r\n(iii)\tCystein-glycine dipeptidase (or other peptidases)\r\n\r\nGamma-glutamyl-cyclotransferase and 5-oxoprolinase are probably NOT present in lower euks (yeast) and microbes, but the issue is still being debated (for example, see review by (Penninckx and Elkens, 1993)\r\n",

Yet the evolutionary history of glutathione biosynthesis is convoluted, and other aerobic microorganisms use different thiol cofactors to resist oxidative damage (Fahey RC.  2001).  For example, low G+C Gram-positive bacteria produce excess amounts of CoASH for this purpose, whereas high G+C Gram-positive bacteria produce mycothiol or ergothioneine (Fahey RC.  2001).  Gamma-glutamyl-cysteine is produced by Halobacteria (Newton, Javor, 1985; Malki et al., 2009), and trypanothione � by trypanosomatids (Oza et al., 2003).  Methanogenic archaea contain significant amounts of coenzyme M, a thiol cofactor that like glutathione has been recruited into pathways to degrade oxidized metabolites (Allen et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nThe presence in Actinobacteria of the hypothetical protein family currently annotated in SEED as \"Similar to Glutamate--cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.2), function unknown\" is puzzling, since glutathione is NOT produced in these organisms (e.g. fig|246196.1.peg.6211)\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nPenninckx MJ, Elskens MT.  1993.

GSI is a dodecameric protein with subunit ranging between 44 and 60 kDa, and is usually found among several groups of bacteria (Robertson & Alberte, 1996) and archaea (Brown et al., 1994).  GSII is common in eukaryotes and a few soil-dwelling bacteria (Brown et al., 1994) as an octameric enzyme composed of subunits ranging between 35 and 50 kDa (Kumada et al., 1993). Finally, GSIII has been described from cyanobacteria and two anaerobic bacteria as a hexameric enzyme composed of c. 75 kDa subunits (Reyes & Florencio, 1994).

        "notes":["Alginates are a polysaccharides composed of variable ratios of beta-D-mannuronate (M) and its C-5 epimer alpha-L- guluronate (G) linked by 1�4 glycosidic bonds.  Alginate unique physical properties enable it to be used as a stabilizer, viscosifier and gelling agent in the food, beverage, paper, printing and pharmaceutical industries.  Currently all commercially produced alginates are isolated from farmed brown seaweeds, primarily from the genera Laminaria and Macrocystis, but there is a growing interest to bacterial alginate biosynthesis (Rehm, 2010).\r\n \r\nTwo genera of bacteria have been shown to secrete alginate, Pseudomonas and Azotobacter.  Although these two genera utilize very similar molecular mechanisms to produce alginate, in nature, they secrete alginate for different purposes with different material properties: some P. aeruginosa strains (known as mucoid strains) can secrete alginate to aid in the formation of thick highly structured biofilms (Nivens et al., 2001; Hay et al., 2009a), whereas Azotobacter produces a stiffer alginate (with typically a higher concentrations of G residues) which remains closely associated with the cell and allows the formation of desiccation resistant cysts (Sabra and Ping Zeng, 2009).\r\n \r\nThe pathway for bacterial alginate biosynthesis can be loosely divided into four steps: precursor synthesis, polymerization, periplasmic modification/transit and export.  Many of the core genes involved in it are contained within a single 12-gene operon initially described by Chitnis and Ohman (1993): algD, alg8, alg44, algK, algE (algJ), algG, algX, algL, algI, algJ (algV), algF and algA (Pseudomonas gene names are shown with the corresponding Azotobacter gene names in parentheses).   In addition, many more genes relevant for alginate production located outside of this operon have been identified since (for a recent review see PMID:24034361 or PMID:24428834). \r\n\r\nThe best-characterized alginate-producing organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen. Alginate is one important virulence factor, and the conversion of the nonmucoid to the alginate-overproducing mucoid form after infection of cystic fibrosis patients is associated with a decline of pulmonary function and survival rate. Alginate acts as an extracellular matrix material that allows the formation of differentiated biofilms, which restrict diffusion of clinical antibiotics and protect embedded cells against human antibacterial defense mechanisms.\r\n\r\nAlginate is known for being produced under nutrient-limited conditions or as a consequence of impaired energy metabolism. In particular, the algQ promoter responds to nutrient starvation (namely, phosphate limitation) by increasing Ndk expression to compensate for the decrease in NTP and deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis under phosphate-deficient conditions. On the other hand, NTP and dNTP deficiency can also result from a diminished supply of ATP from aerobic respiration, a primary metabolic drawback of iron depletion. This is in keeping with the observed correlation between iron limitation, poor oxygen transfer, and alginate synthesis under controlled bioreactor conditions (PubMed:16030202)\r\n\r\nCell wall-inhibitory antibiotics activate the alginate biosynthesis operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: roles of sigma (AlgT) and the AlgW and Prc proteases.(Mol Microbiol. 2006 Oct;62(2):412-26.)\r\n"],

        "description":"Quoted from PMID:20833577:  \r\nAminoglycoside antibiotics are a complex family of compounds characterized for having an aminocyclitol nucleus (streptamine, 2-deoxystreptamine, or streptidine) linked to amino sugars through glycosidic bonds. In addition, other compounds such as spectinomycin, which is an aminocyclitol not linked to amino sugars, or compounds that include the aminocyclitol fortamine are also included in this family (Bryskier, 2005; Veyssier and Bryskier, 2005). Aminoglycosides are primarily used in the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative aerobic bacilli, staphylococci, and other gram-positives (Yao and Moellering, 2007). Due to the nature of the mechanism of uptake of aminoglycosides, which requires respiration, anaerobic bacteria are intrinsically resistant (see below) (Bryan et al., 1979).\r\n\r\nAminoglycoside resistance mechanisms include: \r\n1. the deactivation of aminoglycosides by various modifications at &#8722;OH or &#8722;NH2 groups of the 2-deoxystreptamine nucleus or the sugar moieties.  Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes include acetyltransferases (AACs), nucleotidyltranferases (ANTs), or phosphotransferases (APHs)\r\n\r\n2. the reduction of the intracellular concentration of aminoglycosides by changes in outer membrane permeability, decreased inner membrane transport, active efflux, and drug trapping \r\n\r\n3. the alteration of the 30S ribosomal subunit target by mutation \r\n\r\n4. the methylation of the aminoglycoside binding site (target modification)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description":"The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest known superfamily of secondary carriers found in the biosphere (PMID:22458847)\r\nE. coli K-12 contains 70 MFS transporters, 15 of which may be considered drug exporters, as they belong to families 2 and 3 (http://www.membranetransport.org/), which are composed of 12-TMS (transmembrane segment) and 14-TMS members, respectively, of drug/H+ antiporters (PMID:22458847). Most of them, however, are free-standing transporters located in the IM and transport drugs from the cytosol to only the periplasm. Because most antimicrobial agents reach the cytosol usually by diffusion across the membrane bilayer, the pumped-out drug molecules have a good chance of reentering the cytosol through this free-diffusion process, and the transporters of this class are not expected to create high-level resistance (PMID:25788514).\r\n\r\nA few MFS pumps, however, occur with their own periplasmic adaptor proteins and with OM channels [such as TolC or other OM factors (OMF)] and presumably produce an efficient tripartite efflux system. In E. coli, these pumps include EmrB (occurring with the cognate adaptor EmrA) and EmrY (with EmrK), which indeed appear to be involved in the efflux of uncouplers and other substrates (PMID:11566977, PMID:1409590). The two operons are similar on the sequence level.  \r\n\r\nEmrY was identified in a screen for genes that reduce the lethal effects of stress. An emrY insertion mutant is more sensitive than wild type to mitomycin C and other stresses and other stresses such as UV irradiation (PMID: 20128927)\r\n\n",

Protein synthesis is blocked by the Stxs through the removal of an adenine residue from the 28S rRNA of the 60S ribosome. This N-glycosidase activity of the toxin resides in the A subunit. The pentamer of identical B subunits mediates toxin binding to the cellular receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Additional commonalities between the Stx groups are that the subunit genes are encoded in an operon with the A subunit gene 5� to that of the B subunit, that the stx operon is usually found within the sequence for an inducible, lysogenic, lambda-like bacteriophage, and that the toxins utilize a retrograde pathway to reach the cytoplasm. Differences between the two toxin groups include the fact that the genes for stx/stx1a are repressed by Fur when high levels of iron are present, and that E. coli strains that encode stx2 are epidemiologically linked to more severe disease than those that carry stx1.\r\n",

In addition to or instead of Stx1, some E. coli strains produce a second type of Stx, Stx2, that has the same mode of action as Stx/Stx1 but that is antigenically distinct. Because subtypes of each toxin have been identified, the prototype toxin for each group is now designated Stx1a or Stx2a.\r\nThe Stxs traffic in a retrograde manner within the cell, such that the A subunit of the toxin reaches the cytosol only after the toxin moves from the endosome to the Golgi and then to the endoplasmic reticulum. In humans infected with Stx-producing E. coli (STEC), the most serious manifestation of the disease, the hemolytic uremic syndrome or HUS, is more often associated with strains that produce Stx2a rather than Stx1a, and that relative toxicity is replicated in mice and baboons. Stx1a and Stx2a also exhibit differences in cytotoxicity to various cell types, bind dissimilarly to receptor analogs or mimics, induce differential chemokine responses, and have several distinctive structural characteristics.\r\nshiga toxins induce apoptosis and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase via in vitro activation of caspases.\r\n"],

CDT is a secreted protein toxin produced by a number of Gram-negative disease-causing bacteria (Campylobacter species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Shigella dystenteriae, enterohepatic Helicobacter species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans - the cause of aggressive periodontitis, and Haemophilus ducreyi - the cause of chancroid). The functional toxin is composed of three proteins; CdtB potentiates a cascade leading to cell cycle block, and CdtA and CdtC function as dimeric subunits, which bind CdtB. The toxin is internalized via dynamin-dependent endocytosis into early and late endosomes. The CdtB subunit further transits to the Golgi complex, and is then retrogradely transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Translocation from the ER does not require the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and protein unfolding. Here CdtB enters the nucleus and exhibits a DNase I-like activity that results in DNA double-strand breaks leading to cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and cell death.\r\n",

The result of CDT activity can differ somewhat depending on the eukaryotic cell types affected. Epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes undergo G2 cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and death; fibroblasts undergo G1 and G2 arrest, cellular distension, and death; and immune cells undergo G2 arrest followed by apoptosis. CDT contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting both cellular and humoral immunity via apoptosis of immune response cells, and by generating necrosis of epithelial-type cells and fibroblasts involved in the repair of lesions produced by pathogens resulting in slow healing and production of disease symptoms. Thus, CDT may function as a virulence factor in pathogens that produce the toxin. H. hepaticus CDT has been shown to play a crucial role in promoting the progression of infectious hepatitis to pre-malignant, dysplastic lesions via activation of a pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB pathway and increased proliferation of hepatocytes, providing the first evidence that CDT has carcinogenic potential in vivo.\r\n"],

        "description":"This Subsystem encodes a group of 36 FadD paralogous long-chain fatty-acid-CoA ligases that are present in every Mycobacterial genome. In general, it is next to impossible to distinguish these closely related proteins. This family is different, however, as it was addressed in 2 Nature publications and an ID number was assigned to each of the 36 members (FadD1 through FadD36).  They are interesting for several reason, but mostly because some of the 36 paralogs are not using CoA to activate fatty acids, but AMP instead! A solid publication in Nature claims this new biochemistry and lists specific paralogs (out of the 36) that are likely doing this (below).\r\n\r\nNature. 2004 Mar 25;428(6981):441-5.\r\nEnzymic activation and transfer of fatty acids as acyl-adenylates in mycobacteria.\r\nTrivedi OA, Arora P, Sridharan V, Tickoo R, Mohanty D, Gokhale RS.\r\nAbstract\r\nThe metabolic repertoire in nature is augmented by generating hybrid metabolites from a limited set of gene products. In mycobacteria, several unique complex lipids are produced by the combined action of fatty acid synthases and polyketide synthases (PKSs), although it is not clear how the covalently sequestered biosynthetic intermediates are transferred from one enzymatic complex to another. Here we show that some of the 36 annotated fadD genes, located adjacent to the PKS genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, constitute a new class of long-chain fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs). These proteins activate long-chain fatty acids as acyl-adenylates, which are then transferred to the multifunctional PKSs for further chain extension. This mode of activation and transfer of fatty acids is contrary to the previously described universal mechanism involving the formation of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters. Similar mechanisms may operate in the biosynthesis of other lipid-containing metabolites and could have implications in engineering novel hybrid products.\r\nPMID: 15042094\r\n",

        "description":"The toxic solvents tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) have been widely used as degreasers and chemical feedstocks and present now the most common groundwater contaminants. A variety of microbe-mediated processes can catalyze conversion of these chlorinated solvents to harmless products. \r\nIn aerobic environments, TCE, dichloroethenes (DCEs), and vinyl chloride (VC) are cometabolized by bacteria containing oxygenases, such as methane monooxygenase, toluene monooxygenase, and toluene dioxygenase, but PCE is not transformed. \r\nAnaerobic bacterial degradation of PCE proceeds readily via reductive dehalogenation to TCE, cis-1,2-DCE, VC, and ethene. In contaminated anaerobic environments, dechlorination often terminates at DCE or VC, but only rarely a complete dechlorination to ethene happens. Complete reductive dechlorination of PCE and TCE to ethene or ethane has also been observed in anaerobic enrichment cultures. Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, is able to completely dechlorinate PCE to ethene.\r\nThe dehalogenation reactions unique to dehalorespiring bacteria are catalyzed by reductive dehalogenases (RDases), many of which have been purified and characterized. The identified substrates of these enzymes are either chlorinated ethenes or substituted chloroaromatics. Chloroethene RDases are membrane bound, or anchored to the membrane through an accessory protein. All contain cobalamin and iron-sulfur clusters.\r\n",

        "description":" The biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a vitamin and redox cofactor of quinoprotein dehydrogenases, is facilitated by an unknown pathway that requires the expression of six genes, pqqA to -F.\r\n  Pyrroloquinoline quinone [4,5-dihydro-4,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrolo-[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylic acid (PQQ) is an aromatic, tricyclic ortho-quinone that serves as the redox cofactor for several bacterial dehydrogenases. Among the best known examples are methanol dehydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase. PQQ belongs to the family of quinone cofactors that has been recognized as the third class of redox cofactors following pyridine nucleotide- and flavin-dependent cofactors.\r\n PQQ is derived from the two amino acids glutamate and tyrosine encoded in the precursor peptide PqqA. Five reactions are necessary to form this quinone cofactor:\r\n The first step of the whole pathway is the expression of PqqA as a precursor for PQQ. PqqA is recognised by PqqE, which links the C atoms from the glutamate and tyrosine to become C9 and C9a of the final product PQQ and, therefore, enables recognition and acceptance of the modified PqqA by PqqF. In step two PqqF afterwards cuts out the linked amino acids. The following Schiff base reaction is spontaneous, the following dioxygenation is catalysed by an unknown enzyme. To finally finish the product PqqC facilitates the last cyclization and oxidation steps.\r\n\r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae needs six genes, seven genes are required in Methylobacterium extorquens (AM1), whereas Acinetobacter calcoaceticus requires only four genes for PQQ synthesis. Interestingly, the homologous enzymes of PqqF and PqqG of Methylobacterium extorquens strain AM1 are missing. Although, much is known about the enzymes that use PQQ as a cofactor relatively little is known about its biosynthesis.\r\n Basic reference:\r\nPuehringer S, Metlitzky M, Schwarzenbacher R.

        "notes":["==========Enzymes of the pathway:==============\r\n\r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae was initial model, switched to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 b/c PqqA ORF wasn't called in K. pneumoniae.\r\n\r\n    PqqA is 24-29 aa peptide, see refs. 4 and 7.  Not widely conserved, except for glu-X-X-X-tyr motif.  Some PqqA must be present for PQQ biosynthesis by this pathway.  Alternate pathway without using PqqA may exist in Methylobacterium extorquens (see ref. 11)  Orf is missing from Klebsiella pneumoniae and others.  Variant codes assume presence of PqqA in all instances of the subsystem (even if missing from column b/c orf not yet named).\r\n \r\n    PqqB may be indirectly involved in transport across cytoplasmic membrane?  It may modify existing transport system for PQQ intermediate transport (ref. 13). It has been reported that a knock out of PqqB produces small amounts of PQQ in the cytosol [24] and that no PQQ is secreted into the periplasm. The amount of PQQ in the cytosol was in an equimolar relationship to PqqC. This finding indicates that PqqB is not directly required for PQQ biosynthesis but a carrier for PQQ and responsible for its transport across the plasma-membrane into the periplasm, where the bacterial dehydrogenases reside. Therefore, it is likely that PqqC needs an acceptor for PQQ because it can react with oxygen to generate free radicals [25]. PqqB could be required for the release of PQQ from PqqC and could act as PQQ-acceptor.\r\n\r\n PqqC catalyzes final step in PQQ biosynthesis. It is a cofactor-free oxygenase and is the signature  protein for this subsystem.  It oxidizes (8e-) intermediate (3a-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-4,5-dioxo-4,5,6,7,8,9-hexahydroquinoline-7,9-dicarboxylic acid) to PQQ. See ref. 1b and 6.\r\n\r\n PqqC/D is a protein fusion that has been found to occur in Methylobacterium extorquens (see ref. 12).  Methylobacterium extorquens is not here (not in SEED), but Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum is an example of this subsystem variant. \r\n\r\n PqqE has metal-binding motif, pqqE genes show some regions of identity to moa genes and nifB.  Provides cofactor for other component of subsystem.  See ref. 8.\r\n\r\n PqqF is endopeptidase, low specificity (many different peptidases may play necessary role), MDP can substitute (some similarity to eukaryotic microsomal/membrane peptidases)?  E. coli has ORF that may  play similar functional role when PqqABCD are heterologously expressed (GenBank X71917) (see ref. 8.) Hence, PqqF is most likely a metalloendopeptidase involved in processing of the tyrosine and glutamate of PqqA at R1�R3 with a Zinc centre in its active site. Its sequence has homologies (sequence identities of 15�20%) to insulin-degrading enzymes and protease III of Bacteria. \r\n\r\nPqqD seems like it should be in Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 and Pseudomonas fluorescens PfO-1, haven't found it yet.\r\n \r\n========== References :====================\r\n\r\n1a.

        "description":"Free and protein-bound methionine residues are easily oxidized to methionine sulfoxides by various reactive oxygen species.  However, the oxidized methionines can be reduced back to methionine by repair enzymes, the methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs). Two distinct families of these enzymes, MsrA and MsrB, have evolved for stereospecific reduction of methionine sulfoxide residues in proteins (Kim, et al., 2008).  MsrA is specific for the reduction of the S-form of methionine sulfoxide, whereas MsrB is specific for the R-form. Msrs are present in most organisms in all three domains of life, but are absent in some hyperthermophiles, parasites, and organisms with minimal genomes.  They have been even found in anaerobic bacteria, where their presence may be due to the role in protein repair and antioxidant defense when transiently exposed to oxygen (Kim et al., 2008).  Msrs play a pivotal role in the repair of oxidatively damaged proteins and defend cells from oxidative stress. Therefore, these proteins are viewed as protein repair and antioxidant enzymes.  These enzymes have been implicated in regulation of physiological and pathological processes such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases.\r\n",

Selenoprotein MsrBs are found in invertebrates and vertebrates, but not in bacteria or plants.  For example, among three mammalian methionine-R-sulfoxide reductases, MsrB1 is a Sec-containing protein, whereas MsrB2 and MsrB3 contain Cys in the active site.  In contrast, selenoprotein forms of MsrA are also found in bacteria (albeit very few) and in lower eukaryotes, including Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOB, Alkaliphilus oremlandi OhILAs, Natranaerobius thermophilus JW/NM-WN-LF, and a unicellular green alga  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The reason why some enzymes evolve into selenoproteins if the Cys versions may be sufficient is not understood, and MsrA and MsrB might serve as an excellent system for addressing the question of why Sec is used in biological systems (Kim et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2005).

The routes involved in the specific degradation of aromatic compounds into the PhAc or PhAc-CoA intermediates are called upper pathways of the PhAc-CoA catabolon (covered by other subsystems). This catabolon may be the first example of a hybrid pathway because, although it is aerobic, its catabolic intermediates (aryl-CoA derivatives) were, until recently, considered to be specific to the anaerobic catabolic pathways. The PhAc-CoA catabolon (core) was shown to contain (i) a transport system (PaaL and PaaM); (ii) a PhAc-activating enzyme, i.e. the PhAc-CoA ligase (PaaF); (iii) a ring-hydroxylating complex (PaaG, PaaH, PaaI, PaaJ and PaaK); (iv) a ring-opening protein (PaaN); (v) a &#946;-oxidation-like system (PaaA, PaaB, PaaC and PaaE); and (vi) two regulatory proteins (PaaX and PaaY).

        "description":"The characteristic shape of bacterial cells is mainly determined by the cell wall, the synthesis of which is orchestrated by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  Rod-shaped bacteria have two distinct modes of cell wall synthesis, involved in cell elongation and cell division, which are believed to employ different sets of PBPs.  A long-held question has been how these different modes of growth are co-ordinated in space and time.  Recently key players in the elongation-division cycle of Bacillus subtilis have been identified (Claessen et al., 2008): the cell division protein EzrA, and a newly discovered protein GpsB  (for guiding PBP1 shuttling).  Mutations in these genes have a synthetic phenotype with defects in both cell division and cell elongation.  Furthermore, these phenotypes are tightly associated with disturbed localization of the major transglycosylase/transpeptidase of the cell, PBP1, which is involved in both  elongation and division, dynamically relocates from the  septum to the lateral wall during the cell cycle.  EzrA and GpsB have partially differentiated roles in the localization cycle of PBP1, with EzrA mainly promoting the recruitment of PBP1 to division sites, and GpsB facilitating its removal from the cell pole, after the completion of pole maturation (Claessen et al., 2008)\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nClaessen D, Emmins R, Hamoen LW, Daniel RA, Errington J, Edwards DH. 2008.

        "description":"Pathogenic mycobacteria require type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport virulence factors across their complex cell envelope. These bacteria have up to five of these systems, termed ESX-1 to ESX-5. This Subsystem encodes locus ESX-4 in all Mycobacterial genomes currently available in the SEED database.\r\n\r\nESAT-6, the 6 kDa early secreted protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a potent T-cell antigen, is the prototype of a novel family of small proteins (ESX) of unknown function produced by several Gram(+) microorganisms.  The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has 23 ESX proteins, encoded by genes esxA through esxW, arranged in tandem pairs in 11 genomic loci, known as the ESX or ESAT-6 loci \r\n\r\nExport of ESAT-6 and related proteins requires a dedicated secretory apparatus, variously named ESAT-6- , SNM-, ESX-, or type VII secretion system (Bitter et al., 2009). Components of these secretion machinery are commonly encoded by clusters of genes co-localized with the ESAT-6 (ESX) family proteins. Out of the 11 ESX loci in the genome of M. tuberculosis, five (ESX-1 through ESX-5) include secretion system components.  Among them region 4 (Rv3444c-3450c) is believed to be ancestral.  Only the ESX-1 region (corresponding to RD1) is encoded in this SS, please see the following subsystems for loci ESX-2 through ESX-5:\r\n\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Firmicutes\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-2)\r\n    ...........\r\nESAT-6 proteins secretion system in Mycobacteria (locus ESX-5)\r\n\r\nConservative gene clusters containing proteins of the ESAT-6/Esx family and the components of the putative secretion system (SNM) have been identified in other Gram-positive pathogens as well, including Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diptheriae and Listeria monocytogenes (Pallen, 2002).  In Staphylococcus aureus SNM  homologues are required for secretion of ESAT-6-like proteins (Burts et al ., 2005).  As with mycobacteria, loss of ESAT-6 secretion in S. aureus  correlates with reduced virulence.  While the role of these homologues in other Gram(+) species is not yet determined, mounting evidence suggests that this alternative secretion system will be important for virulence in many acid-fast and Gram-positive pathogens. \r\n\r\nGiven its role in pathogenesis, it is curious that the ESAT-6/Esx/SNM secretion system also functions in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. M. smegmatis  has a genetic locus homologous to RD1 and is able to secrete ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homologues (Gey Van Pittius et al .,2001; Converse and Cox, 2005). Interestingly, mutations in M. smegmatis SNM homologues not only disrupt secretion of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (Converse and Cox, 2005), but also result in increased conjugal DNA transfer (Flint et al ., 2004).  While the SNM pathway may have different functions in various bacteria, similarity of snm  genes suggests that the core mechanism of SNM secretion is conserved. \r\n\r\n",

        "description":"Daptomycin (DAP), a fermentation product produced by Streptomyces roseosporus, is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic with potent bactericidal activity against most Gram-positive organisms including multiple antibiotic-resistant and -susceptible strains. It exerts its effect through cell membrane disruption (PMID: 17402833).  DAP appears to have a multifaceted effect on cell wall homeostasis that includes leakage of small ions, such as intracellular potassium, leading to loss of membrane potential, and by changes to the cell envelope ultrastructure leading to rapid cell death (PMID: 12878516).  Recent evidence strongly suggests that DAP inserts into the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner and subsequently disrupts the functional integrity of the cell membrane, altering cell division. Fluorescence studies have shown that DAP forms membrane-associated oligomers on liposomes and bacterial cells, suggesting that it is phosphatidylglycerol (PG)-dependent oligomerization of DAP that contributes to its effectiveness in altering membrane homeostasis (PMID: 23114777)\n\nResistance mechanisms: \nThe change in the bacterial cell envelope and biophysical properties of the cell membrane appear to play an important role in the interaction of daptomycin with the cell membrane, and it has been postulated that a more positively charged cell envelope �repels� the cationic daptomycin from the cell membrane, contributing to the development of resistance (PMID:17954690; PMID:21899450). A major factor in the cell-envelope charge is the phospholipid composition of the inner and outer cell-membrane leaflets, such as the negatively charged phospholipid cardiolipin and the positively charged amino derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol. \n\nIn S. aureus, all daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains had a mutation in a phospholipid biosynthesis gene. This included mutations in the previously described mprF gene, L-O-lysylphosphatidylglycerol synthase (PMID:16723576, PMID:12878516), but also in other phospholipid biosynthesis genes, including cardiolipin synthase (cls2) and CDP-diacylglycerol-glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase (pgsA). EM and lipid membrane composition analyses on two clinical pairs showed that the daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains had a thicker cell wall and an increase in membrane lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (PMID:22238576, PMID:17954690; PMID:19289517)\n\nIn Enterococci the development of resistance to daptomycin, like the development of resistance in S. aureus, is associated with alterations in the cell envelope and biophysical properties of the cell membrane. However, the genes linked to these changes in enterococci appear to be different (PMID: 21899450; PMID:23114777) from those reported in S. aureus, with the exception of cardiolipin synthase, which has been implicated in DAP resistance in both taxa, albeit indirectly (PMID:21502617, PMID:23114777) \n\nSpecifically in Enterococci DAP resistance has been linked to mutations in genes that alter the cell envelope stress response [liaFSR, where \"lia\" denotes lipid II cycle-interfering antibiotics protein](PMID:21899450) and changes in enzymes that directly affect phospholipid homeostasis, and these changes may alter membrane composition, such as glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase [GdpD] (PMID:21899450), as well as cardiolipin synthase (above) \n\n\n1.

The primary target of activated INH is an NADH-dependent enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, designated InhA. Mutations within the inhA structural gene or within the inhA promoter have been identified and are associated with both INH and ETH resistance. Missense mutations within the inhA structural gene cause INH resistance by reducing the NADH binding affinity of InhA and thus protecting the enzyme from INH inactivation. The inhA promoter mutations upregulate target expression, producing INH and ETH resistance via a drug titration mechanism. The structural similarity and shared molecular target of INH and ETH led to the hypothesis that ETH must, like INH, undergo cellular activation.\n\nKatG couples the isonicotinic acyl (INH) with NADH to form isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase known as InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acid.\n\nEthA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, binds NADH to form an adduct which inhibits InhA in the same way as isoniazid. Expression of the ethA gene is controlled by EthR, a transcriptional repressor. It is understood that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of ethionamide and so EthR inhibitors are of great interest to co-drug developers. The action may be through disruption of mycolic acid synthesis.\n\nNdh:  a small percentage (10%) of INH-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis are associated with gene Rv1854c, which encodes NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3) (PMID: 17294000).  Mutations in this gene reduce NADH oxidation causing an increase in NADH concentration and depletion of NAD(+). This prevents the peroxidation reactions required for the activation of INH, as well as the displacement of the NADH-isonicotinic acyl complex from InhA enzyme binding site (PMID: 17294000).\n\n"],

        "notes":["Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 2005 Jun;18(6):546-54.\r\n    Characterization of the hrpF pathogenicity peninsula of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.\r\n    Sugio A, Yang B, White FF.\r\n\r\n    Department of Plant Pathology, Throckmorton Hall, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506-5502, USA.\r\n\r\n    The hrp gene cluster of Xanthomonas spp. contains genes for the assembly and function of a type III secretion system (TTSS). The hrpF genes reside in a region between hpaB and the right end of the hrp cluster. The region of the hrpF gene of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is bounded by two IS elements and also contains a homolog of hpaF of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria and two newly identified genes, hpa3 and hpa4. A comparison of the hrp gene clusters of different species of Xanthomonas revealed that the hrpF region is a constant yet more variable peninsula of the hrp pathogenicity island. Mutations in hpaF, hpa3, and hpa4 had no effect on virulence, whereas hrpF mutants were severely reduced in virulence on susceptible rice cultivars. The hrpF genes from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, X. campestris pv. campestris, and X. axonopodis pv. citri each were capable of restoring virulence to the hrpF mutant of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Correspondingly, none of the Xanthomonas pathovars with hrpF from X. oryzae pv. oryzae elicited a hypersensitive reaction in their respective hosts. Therefore, no evidence was found for hrpF as a host-specialization factor. In contrast to the loss of Bs3-dependent reactions by hrpF mutants of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, hrpF mutants of X. oryzae pv. oryzae with either avrXa10 or avrXa7 elicited hypersensitive reactions in rice cultivars with the corresponding R genes. A double hrpFxoo-hpa1 mutant also elicited an Xa10-dependent resistance reaction. Thus, loss of hrpF, hpal, or both may reduce delivery or effectiveness of type III effectors. However, the mutations did not completely prevent the delivery of effectors from X. oryzae pv. oryzae into the host cells.\r\n\r\n"],

        "description":"Tetracyclines (TET) were discovered in the 1940s and exhibited activity against a wide range of microorganisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, rickettsiae, and protozoan parasites. The first tetracycline-resistant bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae, was isolated in 1953. It was in fact the inquiry into molecular mechanisms of TET resistance that opened up the entire field of antimicrobial resitance (ISBN 1-55581-329-1) \r\n\r\nTetracycline resistance is most often due to the acquisition of new genes, which encode either (i) energy-dependent efflux of tetracyclines or (ii) a protein that protects bacterial ribosomes from the action of tetracyclines (Chopra and Roberts, 2001). The latter have high sequence similarity with translation elongation factor EF-G and EG-Tu and have G+C% ranging from 32 and 40%, which is consistent with a gram-positive origin (Roberts, 2005).  Ribosomal protection proteins and TET efflux pumps are the two main mechanisms of TET resistance. In addition, a limited number of bacteria acquire resistance by mutations, which alter the permeability of the outer membrane porins and/or lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane, change the regulation of innate efflux systems, or alter the 16S rRNA.  Reviewed in (Chopra and Roberts, 2001)\r\n\r\nNearly 50 types of TET resistant determinants have been described so far, and new ones are being reported. Dr. Stuart Levy from Tufts is the clearinghouse for naming new TET genes. A new gene must have <79% amino acid identity with all previous characterized TET genes to be recorded.  A detailed up-to-date database is maintained by prof. Marilyn Roberts:  http://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/\r\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/marilynr/tetnomenclature.pdf\r\n\r\nThis Subsystem encodes only TET resistant determinants of the Ribosomal protection type. \r\nFor tetracycline resistant determinants of other types (efflux pumps, drug modifying enzymes, others) see Subsystem \"Tetracycline resistance, efflux and enzymatic types\"\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nFrontiers in Antibacterial Resistance: A Tribute to Stuart B.

Although this compound has not been structurally characterized yet, it�s involvement in virulence of S. aureus in a murine kidney abscess model has been clearly demonstrated (Dale et al., 2004).  It was also shown, that the sbnABCDEFGHI genes comprise an operon, and that iron (via Fur) regulates its transcription (Dale et al., 2004).  The functions of each gene product have not been determined yet. The involvement of the SirABC proteins in the staphylobactin import in S. aureus was shown experimentally (Dale, Sebulsky, and Heinrichs,  2004)\r\n\r\nIt was later suggested by (Challis GL. 2005), based on sequence similarity of the SbnE, SbnC, and SbnF genes with iucA, iucB, iucC respectively (controlling aerobactin biosynthesis in some virulent E. coli strain), that staphylobactin is related to a group of non-peptide siderophores, produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS)-independent mechanism.  Siderophores in this group include aerobactin, rhizobactin 1021, achromobactin, vibrioferrin, alcaligin, and desferrioxamine E (reviewed by Challis, 2005).  Such siderophores are assembled from alternating dicarboxylic acid and diamine or amino alcohol building blocks (which are nevertheless derived from amino acids) linked by amide or ester bonds (Challis GL. 2005)\r\n",

        "description":"Due to its complexity, the [Pyruvate / Acetyl-CoP / Acetyl-P / Acetate] node of central metabolism is encoded in 3 Subsystems (SS):  (i) Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, (ii) Fermentations: Mixed acid, and (iii) this SS: Pyruvate metabolism II: acetyl-CoA, acetogenesis from pyruvate.  The combination of VARIANT CODES of all three SSs provides a draft model of this node in each organism. Variant codes for this SSs (only) are explained below.\r\n\r\nDecarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA can occur oxidatively under aerobic conditions and nonoxidatively under anaerobic conditions. Oxidative decarboxylation, a reaction catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), functions primarily during respiratory metabolism, although some function may be retained during anaerobiosis (e.g. see Wagner et al., 2005).  During anaerobiosis various microorganisms  perform nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by means of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) or Pyruvate:ferredoxin (flavodoxin) oxidoreductase.  Pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) catalyzes  non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde.  In addition, Pyruvate oxidases catalyze the following reactions:\r\nPyruvate -> Acetate + CO2 (EC 1.2.2.2) or \r\nPyruvate -> Acetyl-P + CO2 + H2O2 (EC 1.2.2.3).  The roles of these enzymes in metabolism are not completely clear, and are currently under intense investigation (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2005; Schreiner et al., 2005; Schreiner et al., 2006).\r\n\r\nACETATE DISSIMILATION\r\nIn the majority of eubacteria acetate dissimilation is catalyzed by PTA-ACK pathway (Phosphate acetyltransferase + Acetate kinase). This reversible pathway can also assimilate acetate, but only when it is present in relatively large concentrations and predominantly functions in the catabolic direction in vivo. \r\nIn all acetate-forming Archaea studied so far, the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate and the formation of ATP from ADP and phosphate are catalyzed by a single enzyme, an Acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) (Brasen et al., 2001).  This enzyme represents a novel mechanism of ATP synthesis by the mechanism of substrate-level phosphorylation. ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase is also present in the eukaryotic protists Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia, and homologous proteins have been found in the genomes of several bacteria (see in Musfeldt et al. 1999; Sanchez et al. 2000).  The metabolic function of these putative synthetases in bacteria remains to be demonstrated.  Similarity of these proteins with Protein acetyltransferase, regulating AMP-forming Acetyl-CoA synthetase (Starai et al., 2004) is intriguing. \r\n\r\nACETATE ASSIMILATION\r\nThe catabolism of acetic acid in microorganisms involves condensation of this compound with CoA to form acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) in the presence of ATP and  Mg (Wolfe, 2005).  Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (AMP-forming, EC 6.2.1.1) catalyzes this process in eubacteria and archaea alike.  Although reversible in vitro, this reaction is irreversible in vivo due to the presence of intracellular pyrophosphatases (Wolfe, 2005) and serves as the main route of acetate assimilation.  The reversible PTA-ACK pathway can assimilate acetate as well, but only in relatively large concentrations.\r\nNote that acetate ActP transporter (Gimenez et al., 2003) is often clustered with Acetyl-CoA synthetase (AMP-forming).  \r\nPutative components of the Sir2-like protein acetylation/deacetylation regulatory system for Acetyl-CoA synthetase (Starai et al., 2002 & 2004) are also included in this SS:  (i) NAD-dependent protein deacetylase of SIR2 family, (ii) Protein acetyltransferase.  A different, NAD-independent acetylation/deacetylation regulatory system that uses AcsA as a substrate has been recently described in B. subtilis (Gardner et al., 2006).  It�s orthologs present in many Firmicutes are annotated here as: (iii) Acetyltransferase AcuA, acetyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor and (iv) NAD-independent protein deacetylase AcuC.  The role of AcuB located in the same cluster remains unclear (Gardner et al., 2006) \r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER Acetyl-P-FORMING ENZYMES\r\nAcetyl-P is a central metabolite of vital importance for ATP generation via substrate phosphorylation, as well as several proposed energy-related and signaling roles (Wolfe, 2005).  In addition to PAT and ACK, other enzymes evolving acetyl~P are included in this SS as auxiliary functional roles (SSs encoding them in detail are given below): \r\n\r\n(i) Pyruvate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.3):  Pyr + O2 = Acetyl~P + CO2 + H2O2 (this SS) \r\n(ii) Xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9): Xylulose-5P + Pi <=> Acetyl~P + Glyceraldehyde-3P+ H2O. See SS: Fermentation: Lactate for details.\r\n(iii) Fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.22): Fructose-6P + Pi <=> Acetyl~P Erythrose-4P + H2O. See SS: Fermentation: Lactate for details.\r\n(iv) Sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (XSC, EC 2.3.3.15): Sulfoacetaldehyde + HPO4 = HSO3 + Acetyl~P (dissimilation of sulfonated compounds).  Enzyme is widespread in Proteobact and at least a couple Gram(+)s. In most organisms tested PAT is located in immediate vicinity of XSC \r\n(v)  Glycine reductase (EC 1.21.4.2)  -- present in some strict anaerobes (Arkowitz, Abeles, 1991).  It catalyzes acetyl~P production during reductive deamination of glycine, sarcosine, or betaine : \r\nGlycine + Pi + Thioredoxin = Acetyl~P+ NH3 + Thioredoxin disulfide. See SS: Glycine reductase, sarcosine reductase and betaine reductase.\r\n\r\nIn many organisms these enzymes are located in immediate vicinity of PAT or ACT, suggesting that Acetyl~P formed could be converted by PAT to Acetyl-CoA for anabolism or utilized as P-donor by ACK for ATP generation (Ruff et al., 2003; Wolfe, 2005).\r\n\r\nLACTATE 2-MONOOXYDENASE (EC 1.13.12.4)\r\nin S. pneumoniae, lactate oxidase converts lactate, usually regarded as a dead-end product of glucose metabolism in this organism, back to pyruvate, which is then subject to oxidation by pyruvate oxidase to form acetyl phosphate. Based on this finding, it was proposed that the two H2O2-producing oxidases (pyruvate and lactate) act in a concerted manner in the presence of oxygen to obtain a greater amount of energy from glucose than under anaerobiosis, with acetate rather than lactate being the final product of the system (Taniai, Iida, et al.2008)\r\n\r\nThis subsystem has been initially encoded by master:LienC_UCSD as Acetogenesis_from_Pyruvate.\r\n"},

(The fact that no archaeon seems to have lost the heterodimeric Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase, even when the have Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase, suggests that this latter enzyme is not fully funcitonal as a Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase in Archaea.)\r\n5.

Biochemistry 8: 541-551].)\r\n\r\nThe assignments to eukaryotic Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit C is a guess based on extensive PSI-BLAST searches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinguishing the \"discriminating\" and \"non-discriminating\" Glu-tRNA(Glu) and Asp-tRNA(Asp) synthetases is imprecise (to put it mildly).  In principle, having a non-discriminating synthetase, without the amidotransferase is lethal, as it makes \"mischarged\" tRNA, but does not convert it to the correct amino acid.  Because a non-discriminating synthetase really has two activities, that is how I am annotating them:\r\n\r\n   Discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12)\r\n   Non-discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12); Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) synthetase\r\n   Discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17)\r\n   Non-discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17); Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) synthetase\r\n\r\nFor the time being, assignment to non-discriminating type has been very conservative, in most cases, only when no direct charging enzyme is present, and there is strong evidence for the appropriate amidotransferase.  The problem is that there are a remarkable number of genomes in which there are two Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase genes, at least one of which must be non-discriminating, but there is no obvious criterion for choosing which.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganellar enzymes have not been distinguished.  Mitochondtria and chloroplasts mostly use the indirect charging of tRNA(Gln), and direct charging of tRNA(Asn).\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganism-specific notes:\r\n\r\nAsnRS\r\nArabidopsis AsnRS is not evident\r\n\r\n###############################\r\nLITERATURE\r\n"],

        "description":"Quoted from PubMed:22046172 (van Hoek et al., 2011) -\r\n\"The first macrolide, erythromycin A, was discovered in the early 1950s (McGuire et al., 1952). The main structural component of this molecule is a large lactone ring to which amino and/or neutral sugars are attached by glycosidic bonds.\r\n    Macrolides have a similar mode of antibacterial action and comparable antibacterial spectra as two other antibiotic classes, i.e., lincosamides and streptogramins B. Consequently, these antibiotics, although chemically distinct, have been grouped together as Macrolide�Lincosamide�Streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics (Roberts, 2002). Recently this class of antibiotics was extended due to the development to include synthetic drugs: the ketolides (Zhanel et al., 2002; Ackermann and Rodloff, 2003) and oxazolidinones (Diekema and Jones, 2000), which resulted in the MLSKO family of antibiotics (Roberts, 2008).\r\n    Macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins B inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria (Weisblum, 1995; Roberts, 2002)�\r\n    Bacterial resistance mechanisms to these antibiotics include rRNA methylases, ABC-F type ribosomal protection proteins, efflux pumps, and drug inactivating enzymes (Roberts et al., 1999; Roberts, 2008). The latter group can be further subdivided in esterases, lyases, phosphorylases, and transferases. The most common mechanism of MLS resistance is due to the presence of rRNA methylases, encoded by the erm genes. These enzymes methylate the adenine residue(s) resulting in MLS resistance. The methylated adenine prevents the binding of the drugs from binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. \r\n  This Subsystem encodes only the latter type of resistance. Three additional Subsystems encode other (MLSKO) resistance mechanisms \r\n\n\n",

        "description":"From (Osterman A1, Overbeek R. 2003) -\r\nRiboflavin (vitamin B2) is an ultimate precursor in the biosynthesis of the universal and indispensable flavonoid red-ox cofactors: flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Biosynthesis of riboflavin in the archaea follows an alternate pathway from that found in bacteria and eukarya (see DIAGRAM under Illustrations Tab above). First, an alternative two-step transformation (via a GTP cyclohydrolase III and formamide hydrolase) occurs instead of the established one-step reaction of GTP-cyclohydrolase II characteristic of bacteria, fungi and plants.  Another remarkable variation is the flipped order of the pyrimidine deaminase and reductase steps in eukaryotes and archaea, compared to the standard bacterial biosynthetic route.  Both, fungi and archaea contain a monofunctional reductase, homologous to a corresponding domain of the bi-functional protein (encoded by ribD gene) characteristic of most bacteria.  A monofunctional and non-orthologous eukaryotic deaminase (Pyr_Da) was identified and characterized, while its archaeal counterpart remains a missing gene.  Analysis of chromosomal gene clustering in archaea reveals a strong candidate gene for this functional role.  Orthologs of this gene (e.g., MJ0699 in M. jannaschii) are both distantly related to guanosine deaminase and largely conserved in archaea.  Initial experiments did not provide verification of the expected enzymatic activity of this and several other candidates [81].  In view of the overwhelming genomic evidence available today, the effort to confirm this conjecture is likely to be continued.  \r\n\r\nFrom (Grochowski et al., 2009) -\r\nBiosynthesis of riboflavin in the archaea follows an alternate pathway from that found in bacteria and eukarya (1). See scheme under Illustrations Tab (within thin green banner above). The proposed archaeal pathway begins with the opening of the imidazole ring of GTP by the action of an archaeal GTP cyclohydrolase III (MJ0145, ArfA). The product of this reaction is 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4 (3H)-pyrimidinone 5-monophosphate (FAPy). FAPy is be converted to 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 50-phosphate (APy) by formamide hydrolase (MJ0116, ArfB) (4). APy is then reduced to 5-amino-6-ribitylamino- 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione phosphate by the MJ0671/ArfC gene product (1). A deamination  followed by dephosphorylation (both steps catalyzed by yet unidentified enzymes) then produce the 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (ARP), the precursor of riboflavin (and also of coenzyme F420 in methanogenic Archaea)\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1.

        "notes":["Elements of the subsystem (details are below):\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) synthetase (an activity of the non-discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase) is the first step in the indirect charging of tRNA(Gln).\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase L-asparaginase subunit (EC 6.3.5.-) and Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase transferase subunit (EC 6.3.5.-) are the two subunits of the archaeal second step of the indirect charging of tRNA(Gln).\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit A, B and C are the \"bacterial\" second step of the indirect charging of tRNA(Gln).  In many (or all) cases, the same proteins constitute Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase, the second step in the indirect charging of tRNA(Asn).\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit F (EC 6.3.5.7) is a distant homolog of GatC and performs the same role in fungal mitochondria.\r\n\r\nGlutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because it makes the indirect pathway optional.\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because the non-discriminating form of the enzyme is essential to the pathway.\r\n\r\nAsparaginyl-tRNA synthetase is in the subsystem because its absence makes the transamidase essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nAmong Bacteria, the GatCAB heterotrimeric enzyme seems to have both Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase and Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) amidotransferase activities, even if there is no non-discriminating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.  This can be used for amino acid biosynthesis, not just tRNA charging.  (The original paper describing indirect charging in Bacillis subtilis called it a biosynthetic pathway. [Wilcox, M, and Nirenberg, M.  1968.  Transfer RNA as a cofactor coupling amino acid synthesis with that of protein.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 61: 229-326; also note Griffiths, E, and Bayley, S. T.  1969.  Properties of transfer ribonucleic acid and aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetases from an extremely halophilic bacterium.  Biochemistry 8: 541-551].)\r\n\r\nThe assignments to eukaryotic Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit C is a guess based on extensive PSI-BLAST searches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UniProt roles Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D (EC 6.3.5.-) and Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit E (EC 6.3.5.-) are misnomers taken from the gene names (gatD and gatE).  These two proteins make a heterodimeric, glutamine-specific amidotransferase.  [Feng, L., Sheppard, K., Tumbula-Hansen, D., and Soll, D.  2004.  Gln-tRNAGln formation from Glu-tRNAGln requires cooperation of an asparaginase and a Glu-tRNAGln kinase.  J. Biol. Chem. Dec 16; [Epub ahead of print] ]\r\n\r\nSo, the nomenclature used here is:\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase L-asparaginase subunit (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n= UniProt Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit D (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n\r\nGlutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase transferase subunit (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n= UniProt Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit E (EC 6.3.5.-)\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinguishing the \"discriminating\" and \"non-discriminating\" Glu-tRNA(Glu) and Asp-tRNA(Asp) synthetases is imprecise (to put it mildly).  In principle, having a non-discriminating synthetase, without the amidotransferase is lethal, as it makes \"mischarged\" tRNA, but does not convert it to the correct amino acid.  Because a non-discriminating synthetase really has two activities, that is how I am annotating them:\r\n\r\n   Discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12)\r\n   Non-discriminating Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase = Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12); Aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) synthetase\r\n   Discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17)\r\n   Non-discriminating Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase = Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17); Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) synthetase\r\n\r\nFor the time being, assignment to non-discriminating type has been very conservative, in most cases, only when no direct charging enzyme is present, and there is strong evidence for the appropriate amidotransferase.  The problem is that there are a remarkable number of genomes in which there are two Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase genes, at least one of which must be non-discriminating, but there is no obvious criterion for choosing which.\r\n\r\nSome light is shed by cases in which the \"non-discriminating\" enzyme has lost the ability to charge tRNA(Glu):\r\n\r\n   Skouloubris S, Ribas de Pouplana L, De Reuse H, Hendrickson TL.  2003.  A noncognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase\r\n   that may resolve a missing link in protein evolution.  Proc. Nat.l Acad. Sci. U S A. 100: 11297-302.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganellar enzymes have not been distinguished.  Mitochondtria and chloroplasts mostly use the indirect charging of tRNA(Gln), and direct charging of tRNA(Asn).\r\n\r\n###############################\r\nLITERATURE\r\n"]},

However, recent virulent isolates have become resistant by inactivation of their tlyA gene. We show here that tlyA encodes a 2'-O-methyltransferase that modifies nucleotide C1409 in helix 44 of 16S rRNA and nucleotide C1920 in helix 69 of 23S rRNA. Loss of these previously unidentified rRNA methylations confers resistance to capreomycin and viomycin. Many bacterial genera including enterobacteria lack a tlyA gene and the ensuing methylations and are less susceptible than mycobacteria to capreomycin and viomycin. We show that expression of recombinant tlyA in Escherichia coli markedly increases susceptibility to these drugs. When the ribosomal subunits associate during translation, the two tlyA-encoded methylations are brought into close proximity at interbridge B2a. The location of these methylations indicates the binding site and inhibitory mechanism of capreomycin and viomycin at the ribosome subunit interface.\n\n\n"],

        "description":"The ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, which was originally found in methylotrophic bacteria, is now recognized as a widespread prokaryotic pathway for formaldehyde fixation and detoxification (4, 7). In this pathway, formaldehyde reacts with ribulose 5-phosphate to form D-arabino-3-hexulose 6-phosphate, which is then isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate. These two reactions are catalyzed by D-arabino-3-hexulose 6-phosphate formaldehyde lyase (HPS) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI) respectively.  These two key enzymatic reactions constitute Stage 1 one of the RuMP pathway.\r\n\r\nCyclic ribulose monophosphate pathway - assimilatory\r\n\r\nDuring Stages 2 and 3 a series of interconversions occur that regenerate the RuMP acceptor molecule.  Several variants of these interconverions are possible.  In Stage 2 one of fructose-6-P molecules is split into C3 compounds via one of the two pathways � 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase (KDPGA) pathway using the enzymes of Entner-Doudoroff pathway (net product in this case is pyruvate), or Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) pathway (net product� dihydroxyacetone-P) - see diagram.  \r\n\r\nStage 3 is a sugar rearrangement stage, during which RuMP is regenerated from the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced in Stage 2 and two fructose-6-P molecules produced in Stage 1.  In some organisms this occurs via enzymes of pentose phosphate pathway (so called Transaldolase pathway), in others � via enzymes of Calvin pathway (Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisP aldolase pathway).  Three out of the four possible combinations between stage 2 and stage 3 variants have been described.  The use of KDPGA and SBPA pathways in combination has not been yet reported (D. White, 2000).  Several key enzymes of stages 2 and 3 have been included in this SS as indicators of potential fate of assimilated formaldehyde in an organism.  \r\n\r\nCyclic RuMP pathway - dissimilatory\r\n\r\nThe cyclic formaldehyde oxidation pathway (via 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating (EC 1.1.1.44)) has been shown to play crucial role in C1 metabolism of M. flagellatus KT, most probably as the major energy-generating pathway (Chistoserdova et al., 2000).  It is outlined as dissimilatory branch of RuMP in the RuMP_diagram.  \r\n\r\nUnconventional ribulose monophosphate pathways???\r\n\r\nIn addition to �classic� RuMP pathway, additional connections of the HSP-PHI shunt to core metabolism emerge via analysis of clustering of the corresponding genes with other genes on the chromosome:\r\n\r\n1. In all S. aureus and S. epidermidis genomes the hps-phi gene cluster contains a gene encoding Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.6).  This may indicate channeling of the produced fructose-6-P produced into aminosugars (Taylor et al., 2004).  However, another possibility is the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into RuMP catalyzed by HSP-PHI enzymatic shunt running in reverse.  RuMP may serve as an essential precursor of ribose-5-P, etc.  Toxic formaldehyde produced in this scenario can be dissipated, for instance, via pyruvate formate-lyase (EC 2.3.1.54), present in Staphylococci.  Exogenous sources of glucosamine-6-phosphate in a form of mucopolysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans, etc. may be are readily available from the host of S.aureus.\r\n\r\n2. Another indirect indication of a potential role of the HSP-PHI shunt as a source of ribulose 5-phosphate is clusterization of the hps-phi genes with histidine biosynthetic operon in Aminomonas aminovorus C2A1 (Taylor et al., 2004) and Methylobacillus flagellatus KT � two very diverse methylotrophs.  Two copies of HSP are present in M. flagellatus KT genome with one (fig|265072.1.peg.2071) co-localized as expected with other enzymes of C1 carbon metabolism methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase and TA, while the other (fig|265072.1.peg.2331) is embedded in a histidine biosynthetic operon.  Co-localization of the His operon with the genes catalyzing formation of RuMP can be rationalized by the fact that 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate is required for histidine synthesis.\r\n\r\n3.

        "description":"Efflux pumps of the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) superfamily play a major role in the intrinsic and acquired resistance of Gram-negative pathogens to antibiotics. Moreover, they are largely responsible for multi-drug resistance phenomena in these bacteria, due to the fact that they exists as tripartite complexes with TolC and membrane fusion component, so that the exported drug molecules end up in the external medium, not in the periplasm, and thus cannot easily reenter the cells except by crossing the effective OM permeability barrier\n\nAcrB has been studied most intensively as the prototype of RND pumps (PMID: 24200360). This constitutively expressed pump plays the main role in raising the MICs of most antibiotics in Escherichia coli. It has an extremely wide specificity, including practically all types of antibacterial agents (except aminoglycosides), detergents, microbicides, dyes, free fatty acids, and even simple solvents. A common property of these AcrB substrates is the presence of a hydrophobic domain (PMID:25788514)\n\nInterestingly, the reconstitution of purified AcrB into proteoliposomes indicated that properties of AcrB were optimized in evolution for the exclusion of bile salts, major toxic components in the mammalian intestine, the normal habitat for E. coli (PMID: 10377390)\n\nClosely related RND transporters (characterized in E. coli) are also encoded in this SS --\n- AcrF has a wide substrate specificity, similarly to AcrB, works with AcrA and TolC (PMID:11274125);\n- AcrD is an aminoglycoside efflux pump, also works with AcrA and TolC (PMID:15743938);\n- MdtF (YhiV) is likely involved in the extrusion of toxic metabolites during nitrosative stress, such as the nitrosyl derivative of indole, produced during anaerobic growth of E. coli (PMID:21642439). Forms tripartite system with TolC and membrane fusion component MdtE (PMID:25788514 and references therein)\n\nReferences\n\nClin Microbiol Rev. 2015. 28(2):337-418.

        "description":"Many substrates enter the central carbon metabolism on the level of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). These substrates include: acetate, fatty acids, waxes, alcohols, alkanes, polyhydroxyalkanoates, etc. In aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria OXIDATION of acetyl-CoA proceeds via the citric acid cycle. For the ASSIMILATION of acetyl-CoA the citric acid cycle is modified bypassing the two decarboxylation steps: isocitrate is cleaved into succinate and glyoxylate, which condenses with a second molecule of acetyl-CoA to form malate, resulting in the net fixation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA to one molecule of malate (Kornberg and Krebs, 1957; Ensign, 2006). The malate replenishes oxaloacetate, leaving one succinate and NADH as the products. The cells incorporate the succinate into biomass by first oxidizing it to oxaloaceate from which PEP is synthesized.  The two key enzymes of the so-called glyoxylate cycle are isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (Dixon and Kornberg, 1959). \r\n\r\nIt is clear that glyoxylate cycle can not be the only solution for acetyl-CoA assimilation, because several organisms capable of growth with C2 compounds as sole carbon source, lack isocitrate lyase (ICL) activity, or show labeling pattern after growth on acetate inconsistent with the operation of the glyoxylate cycle (Erb et al., 2007 and refs therein). Several putative pathways for acetate assimilation by such isocitrate-lyase-negative organisms have been proposed (Meister et al., 2005 and refs therein), but none have been elucidated completely. For example -\r\n(1) for purple nonsulfur bacteria, e.g. Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodospirillum rubrum (Ivanovsky et al., 1997), \r\n(2) for methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens (Korotkova et al., 2002), \r\n(3) for streptomycetes (Liu and Reynolds, 1999).  \r\n\r\nAn exciting and elegant work is under way in the labs of Brigit E. Alber and G. Fuchs � the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway of C2 assimilation that they proposed, although far from being completely understood, promises to explain metabolic transformations during growth on acetate in many (if not all) ICL-negative organisms (Alber et al., 2006; ).  It is encoded separately - see SS:\"Ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway of C2 assimilation\"\r\n",

Importantly, LmrCD as also the main system responsible for resistance to bile acid in L. lactis (PMID: 18790870)\r\n\r\nHeterodimeric ABC transporter BmrC/BmrD (former YheI/YheH) in B. subtilis (PMID: 16879641) is homologous to the LmrC/LmrD ABC transporter of Lactococcus lactis, but not orthologous to it, however, based on the position of the two transporters' subunits on phylogenetic trees.   Also, note that Streptococcus suis 98HAH33, Enterococcus casseliflavus EC10  and a few other genomes carry both of these transporters \r\n\r\nTetracycline resistance ABC-type efflux pump TetA(46)/TetB(46) [PMID:22941900] is in fact identical to the BmrCD transporter and is annotated in this database as such.  See Subsystem \"Tetracycline resistance, all mechanisms\" for details\r\n\r\nQuoted from PMID:25217586: \r\n\"In B. subtilis 8 of 78 ABC transport systems encoded in its genome have been classified as potential MDR-like transporters (4). Among these eight is the heterodimeric ABC transporter YheI/YheH, which was renamed BmrC/BmrD (in short BmrCD) due to its homology to the LmrC/LmrD ABC transporter of Lactococcus lactis (PMID: 16879641). Torres et al. (6) used inside-out membrane vesicles to demonstrate that BmrCD can mediate efflux of several fluorescent substrates of MDR-ABC transporters, including Hoechst 33342, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone.  Eleven of 46 antibiotics tested in that study were shown to significantly increase the transcription of the bmrCD operon (6). These included ribosome-targeted antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin and gentamycin, which was consistent with an earlier study on antibiotic-induced gene expression in B. subtilis\"\r\n",

        "notes":["Biotin biosynthesis.\r\n\r\nBiotin (vitamin H) is an essential cofactor for a class of important metabolic enzymes, biotin carboxylases and decarboxylases (Perkins and Pero 2001). Biotin biosynthetic pathway is widespread among microorganisms. The well-studied systems of biotin biosynthesis from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtils, and Bacillus sphaericus differ in the first step of biosynthesis. B. subtils and B. sphaericus use pimeloyl-CoA synthase encoded by the bioW gene to synthesize pimeloyl-CoA from pimelic acid. In E. coli, pimeloyl-CoA is synthesized from L-alanine and/or acetate via acetyl-CoA, instead of pimelic acid (Ifuku et al. 1994), and products of the bioC and bioH genes are required for the pimeloyl-CoA synthesis in E. coli (EC numbers do not assigned). The pathway from pimeloyl-CoA to biotin is similar in E. coli and bacilli and uses products of the bioF, bioD, bioA, and bioB genes. Genes encoding biotin transporters have not been identified in bacteria until recently.\r\nThe biotin operon of E. coli is negatively regulated by biotin and the bifunctional protein BirA (DeMoll 1994). The biotin-protein ligase BirA mediates biotinylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase via a two-step reaction. Firstly, the adenylate of biotin is synthesized from substrates biotin and ATP and, at the second step, transferred to a unique lysine residue on carboxylase. When biotin is unclaimed, two generated BirA-biotinyl-5`-AMP monomers bind cooperatively to the bioO operator between the divergent bioA and bioBCDF operons and repress transcription in both directions. The BirA protein is composed of the N-terminal DNA-binding (D-b) domain containing a helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure, the central domain, and the C-terminal domain. The central catalytic domain contains the binding site for biotinyl-5`-AMP and also is required for transcriptional regulation (Kwon et al. 2000).\r\nUsing comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis, the biotin biosynthetic pathway and the BirA regulon has been described in most available bacterial genomes (Rodionov et al., 2002). Based on analysis of co-occurrence of the biotin biosynthetic genes and bioY in complete genomes, as well as on the distribution of the BirA bining sites, it has been predicted that the transmembrane protein BioY is involved in biotin transport. Different non-orthologous substitutes of the bioC-coupled gene bioH from E. coli (named bioG, bioZ and bioK), observed in several genomes, possibly represent existence of different pathways for the pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis. \r\n\r\n#1,2\tbirA: Biotin-protein ligase (EC 6.3.4.15) and Biotin operon repressor are encoded by the bifunctional protein BirA in E. coli and many other bacteria. The biotin-protein ligase domain is ubiquitous to almost all prokaryodes. In contrast, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain containing a helix-turn-helix structure (Biotin operon repressor domain) is not so widely distributed, showing that BirA-mediated regulation of transcription for the biotin synthesis genes is more-or-less facultative. The predicted BirA-binding sites are well-conserved among various eubacterial and archaeal genomes. Existence of N-terminal DNA-binding domain in BirA strictly correlates with presence of putative BirA-binding sites upstream of biotin operons (Rodionov et al., 2000, Genome Res. 12:1507).\r\n\r\n#3,4,5,6 are widely-distributed genes required for the de novo biotin synthesis from pimeloyl-CoA precursor and form the most conserved part of the pathway. Among the genomes encoding the biotin biosynthetic pathway these genes are missing only in minimal number of species:\r\n#3 (bioF): in Clostridia species, Aquifex, and two Corynebacteria species;\r\n#4 (bioA): several Clostridia species and cyanobacteria,  \r\n#5 (bioD): no missing\r\n#6 (bioB): no missing\r\n\r\n#7,8,9,10,11,12 constitute variants of the pimeloyl-CoA precursor synthesis. \r\n\r\n#7 (bioW): is functionally characterized in several Bacillus species where it is involved in direct synthesize of pimeloyl-CoA from pimelic acid.\r\n\r\n#8,9 (bioC, bioH): In E. coli, pimeloyl-CoA is synthesized from L-alanine and/or acetate via acetyl-CoA, instead of  pimelic acid (Ifuku et al. 1994), and products of the bioC and bioH genes are required for the pimeloyl-CoA synthesis in E. coli. Exact biochemical functions of these two genes were not clear until recently. However, a recent analysis of BioH with a panel of hydrolase assays revealed a carboxylesterase activity with a preference for short acyl chain substrates (Sanishvili et al., 2003, J.Biol.Chem. 278:26039). For BioC, it is possesses S-adenosylmethionine binding motif and belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily.\r\n\r\nThe bioC-bioH gene pair is required for the synthesis of pimeloyl-CoA in E. coli. The bioC gene is widely distributed in bacteria, whereas bioH was not found in many bioC-containing bacterial genomes. Instead, we predict several non-orthologous gene displacements of bioH in some of these genomes. \r\n\r\n#8,10 (bioC, bioG): A possible non-orthologous displacement of bioH by another gene, named bioG, was detected by bioinformatic analysis in some proteobacteria, the CFB group of bacteria, and Fusobacterium (Rodionov et al., 2000, Genome Res. 12:1507). The bioG gene always forms an operon with bioC and other biotin synthesis genes in these genomes; furthermore, in Bacteroides fragilis there is a single gene encoding a fused protein BioC-BioG. Most gamma-proteobacteria except Pasteurellaeceae possess the bioC-bioH gene pair, whereas all Pasteurellaeceae have bioC-bioG. Notably, Neisseria meningitidis has both bioC-bioH and bioC-bioG gene pairs, and the latter likely has been acquired from Haemophilus influenzae or a closely related bacterium, as the respective genes are highly similar. The phylogenetic tree of the BioC family has a separate branch for the proteins associated with BioG.\r\n\r\n#8,11 (bioC, bioK): Another bioC-linked gene, named bioK, was found in some cyanobacteria. The genomes of Synechococcus sp. and Prochlorococcus marinus contain the bioFKCDA operon and the bioB gene. Two other cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. and Nostoc sp., have all biotin biosynthetic genes except bioC and bioK. Therefore, they possibly use a different pathway for the pimeloyl-CoA synthesis.\r\n\r\n#8,12 (bioC, bioZ): Another bioC-linked gene, named bioZ, was found in rhizobia (alpha-proteobacteria), where it is the last gene in the biotin biosynthesis operon. It was recently shown that the bioZ gene from the bioABFDZ operon of Mesorhizobium loti can complement bioH of E. coli (Sullivan et al. 2001). \r\n\r\nThe observed diversity of enzymes for the first step of the biotin biosynthesis (pimeloyl-CoA synthesis) can reflect either frequent non-orthologous gene displacements, or possible use of different substrates for the biotin biosynthesis.\r\n\r\n#13 (bioY): Based on analysis of co-occurrence of the biotin biosynthetic genes and bioY in complete genomes, the hypothetical transmembrane protein BioY was predicted to be involved in biotin transport  (Rodionov et al., 2000, Genome Res. 12:1507). bioY is widely distributed in bacteria and often clusters with genes of biotin metabolism. The homologs of BioY form a unique protein family  (InterPro entry IPR003784), and have no significant similarity with any gene of known function. Analysis of the BirA regulatory sites showed that bioY is always under regulation of the biotin repressor in the genomes containing a regulatory domain of BirA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"]},

        "description":"The classical Entner-Douderoff (ED) pathway of bacteria (and a limited number of lower eukaryotes) starts with the phosphorylation of either glucose or its oxidized derivative gluconate.  The generated 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) is converted by an aldol cleavage, resulting in the formation of GAP and pyruvate.  The triose phosphate is activated by Pi , and is further degraded to pyruvate by enzymes that are identical with those of the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway.  The main difference between the ED and EM pathways is that, in the former, both NADPH and NADH are formed (instead of 2 NADH in EM), and that substrate-level phosphorylation only yields a single ATP per glucose molecule (ref. 1,2).\r\n\r\nED-like pathways found in archaea are modified in two ways:  \r\nIn semi-phosphorylative pathway (Variant code 2) 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) is phosphorylated to KDPG by KDG kinase, instead of conversion of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, common for eubacteria. \r\nIn non-phosphorylative pathway, none of hexose intermediates are phosphorylated, instead activation via phosphorylation occurs at the level of 2P-glycerate by D-glycerate 2-kinase (Variant code 3).\r\nIn several species both - semi-phosphorylative and non-phosphorylative ED pathways appear to be operational (Variant code 4) � like in Sulfolobus and Thermoproteus tenax\r\n\r\nWhile semi-phosphorylative ED pathway (via KDPG) is expected to have a similar net result as the classic eubacterial route, there appears to be no net generation of ATP by the non-phosphorylative ED pathway (via KDG).  \r\n\r\nNote, that a gene encoding 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31) is has not been experimentaly  detected in several taxonomic groups, including Firmicutes.  An interesting candidate (BC3368 in B. cereus) has been predicted for the genus Bacillus by Ivanova et al (2003).  It�s widely spread homologs in other Gram(+)s species have been assigned with this function here as well.  \r\n\r\nFunctional role \"6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating (PglDH)\" has been included in this SS merely as an indicator of the presence of functional Pentose Phosphate pathway in an organism.\r\n",

Hence, either KDPGA is a misannotation (and the enzyme has only 4-Hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase activity) and ED cannot be asserted, or alternatively, KDPGA activity is indeed present, hence ED is functional.  In this case PglD is a �missing gene� and needs to be searched for.\r\n\r\n6  = no PglD, but KDGK and KDPGA are present.

        "description":"Some bacteria can utilize glycolate as a carbon and energy source in aerobic conditions. This compound is abundant in nature and especially in algae or plants, where it is an important metabolite of photorespiration, often secreted.  For example, in marine environment glycolate is a phytoplankton-specific exudate generated during autotrophic photorespiration (e.g. Fogg, 1983; Edenborn and Litchfield, 1987, Lau et al., 2006). Glycolate can compose a substantial proportion (10�50%) of phytoplankton-excreted dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in marine environments (Edenborn and Litchfield, 1987; Leboulanger et al., 1998). \n\nInternally in microorganisms glycolate is formed (i) from 2-phosphoglycolate, a product of some DNA repair processes (Pellicer et al., 2003), by the action of ubiquitous Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (see SS: �2-phosphoglycolate salvage� for details); (ii) from glycoaldehyde via Glycoaldehyde-DH/Aldehyde-DH; and (iii) in cyanobacteria via the oxygenase activity of RUBISCO.\n\nIn bacteria glycolate is oxidized into glyoxylate by the enzyme glycolate oxidase (EC 1.1.99.14), a membrane-bound dehydrogenase that appears to be coupled to the electron transport chain for energy generation (Lord, 1972; Sallal and Nimer, 1989).  More energy is generated when glyoxylate enters the TCA cycle (Ornston and Ornston, 1969; Lord, 1972). E.g. in marine bacteria, glycolate is thought to represent a major energy source that drives uptake of other compounds (Lau et al., 2006).  Plants and animals contain a different type of glycogen oxidase - a directly O2-coupled, H2O2-producing enzyme (EC 1.1.3.15).  It�s putative homologs are present only in a few prokaryotes (mostly cyanobacteria) with complete genome sequences available to date (Eisenhut et al., 2006). \n\nA hypothetical operon similar to GlcFDE, but containing only 2 out of 3 subunits, has been annotated here as HypFDR.  It is not clear, whether or not it encodes glycolate oxidase. \n\nThe oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate is counterbalanced by constitutive glyoxylate reductase activity, converting glyoxylate back into glycolate, catalyzed by Glyoxylate/ Hydroxypuryvate reductases, acting as a mechanism to remove the excess of highly reactive glyoxylate, thus preventing its conversion to oxalate (Rumsby, Cregeen, 1999).  The net flux of carbon in either direction depends on the relative rate of the oxidative and the reductive processes in an organism.  The presence of more than one enzyme with glyoxylate reductase activity in a given organism occurs frequently. These enzymes are all related to hydroxypyruvate reductases, and they usually act on both glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate (Nunez et al., 2001).  The majority of these enzymes display marked preference for NADPH over NADH cofactor (Nunez et al., 2001; Rumsby, Cregeen, 1999), with a notable exception of strictly NADH-specific archaeal enzymes (Ohshima T, et al., 2001).  However, since cofactor specificity has been tested in only a handful of species, all other orthologs were annotated here as potentially NAD(P)H�specific: Glyoxylate reductase (EC 1.1.1.79) / Glyoxylate reductase (EC 1.1.1.26)\n",

        "notes":["This is RossO's subsystem temporarily hijacked by Andrei and Dmitry.\n\n===================\nRoss' comment on transporters.  I have labeled many regulators as \n\n    Histidine utilization repressor\n\nThese may represent several distinct types of regulation.  At this stage, I am simply trying to gather regulators that are implicated in histidine utilization.\n=============================================================\n\nCOMMENTS FROM ANDREW HANSEN'S experimental version\n\n1. Histidine degradation involves 3 core enzymes HutH, HutU, HutI, which convert histidine to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU).  Thereafter, there are three routes to glutamate. \n\n2. The most common two routes in bacteria involve (a) conversion of FIGLU to formylglutamate by HutF, then hydrolysis of formylglutamate by HutG, or (b) hydrolysis of FIGLU to glutamate by FIGLU formiminohydrolase.\n\n3. A less common route in bacteria involves folate: conversion of FIGLU to glutamate by glutamate formiminotransferase, giving 5-formimino-THF, and conversion of 5-formimino-THF to 5,10-methenyl-THF by 5-formimino-THF cyclodeaminase. This is the sole route in mammals. In mammals and in certain bacteria the formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase are fused (N- and C-terminal regions, respectively).\n\n4. Plants lack the 3 core enzymes of histidine degradation. However, they have a formiminotransferase-like protein, but not a cyclodeaminase protein. This anomaly was noted soon after completion of the Arabid�opsis genome (1).  The stand-alone plant formiminotransferase-like protein has a homolog in some mammals; this is quite distinct from the bifunctional formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase. The predicted (PHYRE) 3D structure of the plant protein is a very good match to the formimino�transferase domain of the pig enzyme (2). Residue conservation relative to the pig enzyme is not conclusive, but in general the conservation of ligand-binding and catalytic residues in the plant protein is no poorer than in bacterial proteins that almost certainly have formimino�transferase activity.  In particular the putative catalytic residue His82 is conserved and is situated in the most conserved region of the protein.\n\n5. The formiminotransferase of the mammalian (pig liver) has low activity against 5-formyl-THF as well as 5-formimino-THF. The Km values for THF/5-formyl-THF are lower than for THF/5-formimino-THF, but the Vmax value is 3400-fold lower (3,4). The crystal structure of the pig enzyme includes 5-formyl-THF (not 5-formimino-THF) as bound ligand (2).\n\n6. 5-Formyl-THF is a stable, inhibitory folate formed mainly from 5,10-methenyl-THF by a side-reaction of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, GlyA) (5,6). It is reconverted to 5,10-methenyl-THF by 5-formyltetra�hydrofolate cycloigase (5-FCL). In principle, any genome with SHMT should have a 5-FCL. In practice, most do. The majority of the exceptions are obligate intracell�ular organisms/pathogens, which have undergone genome reduction and presumably rely on the host to metabolize 5-formyl-THF. \n\n7. But among bacteria there remain 33 genomes in which 5-FCL (or a 5-FCL-like protein) is missing. Of these, 26 (76%) have a formiminotrans�ferase, generally with the other histidine degradation genes. In some cases, the formiminotransferase is fused to cyclo�deaminase. In one genome (Syntrophus autotrophicus) the formiminotrans�fer�ase is present alone, with none of the other histidine degradation enzymes (as in plants). For comparison, among 578 genomes with 5-FCL, only 16 (3%) have formiminotransferase. Thus 5-FCL and formiminotrans�ferase are strongly anticorrelated. The anticorrelation is not perfect: there are 8 bacterial genomes with no 5-FCL and no formiminotrans�ferase, and (as noted above), 16 genomes with both.\n\n8. Hypothesis: the formyltransferase activity of formiminotransferase replaces 5-FCL in most bacteria that lack it, and the stand-alone formiminotransferase protein in plants and mammals is a formyltransferase that provide a supplemental way of metabolizing 5-formyl-THF.\n\n9. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis:\n\n- Yeast cannot utilize 5-formyl-THF when 5-FCL is ablated (5), and yeast has no formiminotransferase to provide an alternative route.\n\n- Arabidopsis 5-FCL knockout plants show an 8-fold increase in mitochondrial 5-formyl-THF but only a 2-fold overall accumulation, and do not have a strong phenotype. This suggests there is another route for disposing of 5-formyl-THF, most likely cytosolic. Both the short and long forms of the Arabidopsis protein (both of which have cDNA support) are predicted to be cytosolic\n\n- The plant gene formiminotransferase-like gene is expressed at a moderately low level in all organs, similar to 5-FCL except for pollen and flowers, in which the formiminotransferase-like gene is far more strongly expressed. This expression pattern is consistent with a housekeeping function. Although folates in pollen have not been examined, folates in dry seeds and in fungal spores (6) are predomin�antly 5-formyl-THF.\n\n- As judged from EST abundance, the mammalian formiminotransferase-like gene is expressed at a low level (22 mammal ESTs from defined organs in dBEST), in diverse organs (Kidney, prostate, spleen, pancreas, placenta, colon, lymph nodes, liver. This is consistent with a low-level housekeeping function. For comparison, there are >>200 ESTs of 5-FCL, also from diverse tissues.\n\n10. Evidence inconsistent with this hypothesis:\n\n- The plant and mammalian formiminotransferase-like proteins form a distinct clade, separate from mammalian bifunctional formiminotransferase-cyclodeam�in�ase plus all the bacterial monofunctional and bifunctional proteins. Therefore these eukaryote proteins may differ in function from the bacterial ones. \n\n11. Note on genes annotated as 'Formiminotetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase (EC 4.3.1.4)' that are not accompanied by a formiminotransferase gene (e.g., Nocardia, Chlorobium, many Clostridia). These are usually clustered with genes annotated 'folD'. They are probably methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase. Rationale: \n\nFchA from Methylobacterium is a monofunctional methenyl tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, without methylene-THF dehydrogenase activity (7). It has sequence similarity to porcine formimino-THF cyclodeaminase domain, but FchA does not have this activity. These enzymes are grouped in the FTDC-C superfamily. The reactions they mediate are similar:\n\n5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate + H(2)O <=> 10-formyltetrahydrofolate\n5-formiminotetrahydrofolate <=> 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate + NH(3)\n\nSince stand-alone FTDC-C superfamily proteins usually are clustered with genes annotated as folD, if they are in fact monofunctional methylene-THF dehydrogenases, as in yeast (8), then the stand-alone FTDC-C proteins could simply be their partners.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In Salmonella typhimurium LT2 [B], HutU (Urocanate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.49) is a missed gene - there is an untranslated gap between HutC (repressor) and HutH. HutU homologs are present in this segment in other Salmpnellas, eg ig|321314.4.peg.579: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Choleraesuis str. SC-B67. Give a code 1.010.x\n2. Add a new role: Histidine utilization repressor HutC; Present in Shewanella. Just started.\n3. Add a new role: Predicted histidine transporter HutT. Just started.\n(PS: look up HutP antiterminator)\n4. Mysterious variants -1.x in Acinetobacter and Strep. thermophilus - to look up for.\n\n====================\n\nVariant codes are 0, -1 , or 1.xyz where\n\n       x is 0 if GluF is not present and 1 if it is,\n       y is 0 if HutG is present and 1 if it is, and\n       z is 1 iff NFD and ForI are both present.\n================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I posted to the subsystems forum:\n-----\nI recently constructed a subsystem for histidine degradation as an\nexercise.  KEGG shows the pathway as containing three initial steps:\n\n    1. Histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3)\n\n    2. Urocanate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.49)\n\n    3. Imidazolonepropionase (EC 3.5.2.7)\n\nThese are followed by three alternatives:\n\n    4a. Glutamate formiminotransferase (EC 2.1.2.5)\n\n    4b. Formiminoglutamase (EC 3.5.3.8)\n\nand\n\n    4c1. N-formylglutamate deformylase (EC 3.5.1.68)\n    4c2. Formiminoglutamic iminohydrolase (EC 3.5.3.13)\n\nThat is, the pathway will be complete if you have (1,2,3) and either\n\n     4a, 4b, or the pair (4c1,4c2).\n\nWhat I discovered is that there is no sequence in entrez (or KEGG)\nwith the function 4c2.\n\nThere are numerous (over 20) beautiful clusters with an obvious\ncandidate for 3.5.3.13.  For example, in\n\n     Caulobacter crescentus CB15\n\nthe gene with RefSeq id: NP_419777.1 and UniProt id: uni|Q9A9L9 is, I\nassert, a gene playing the functional role Formiminoglutamic\niminohydrolase (EC 3.5.3.13).\n-------\n\nI have included \n\n      Formiminotetrahydrofolate cyclodeaminase (EC 4.3.1.4)\n\neven though it is part of folate metabolism.  When Glutamate formiminotransferase (EC 2.1.2.5)\nis used to go to L-glutamate, 5-formimidoyltetrahydrafolate is produced as a by-product.\n4.3.1.4 is functionally-coupled to the form of the pathway containing 2.1.2.5 in a number of cases.\n\n\n==========\n\nNote the situation in \n\n     Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202 \n\nin which we see an embedded gene assigned the function\n\n     N-carbamoyl-L-amino acid hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.87)\n\nwhile we need 3.5.3.13.  The description of 3.5.1.87 \n\nSee http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC3/5/1/87.html for the following description:\n.......\nCommon name: N-carbamoyl-L-amino-acid hydrolase\n\nReaction: N-carbamoyl-L-2-amino acid (a 2-ureido carboxylate) + H2O = L-2-amino acid + NH3 + CO2\n\nSystematic name: N-carbamoyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolase\n\nComments: The enzyme has broad specificity for carbamoyl-L-amino acids, although it is inactive on the carbamoyl derivatives of glutamate, aspartate, arginine, tyrosine or tryptophan. Carbamoyl-L-valine is the best substrate. It is inactive on derivatives of D-amino acids, the substrates of EC 3.5.1.77 (N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid hydrolase), or on N-carbamoyl-b-alanine, the substrate of EC 3.5.1.6 (b-ureidopropionase). The enzyme hydrolyses formyl derivatives rapidly, and acetyl derivatives very slowly. Mn2+, Ni2+ or Co2+ enabled reactivation of enzyme that had been treated with a chelating agent.\n.......\n\nWhat we need is something that actually works on N-formyl-L-glutamate.\n\nSee also uni|Q82HL3 in Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680.  It to is similar to the gene \nlabeled \n\n    \n     N-carbamoyl-L-amino acid hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.87)\n\nin Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202.  These are all part of a subfamily that plays the role \n3.5.3.13 or is involved in slightly different chemistry.  However, it is part of this\nhistidine degradation pathway.\n\n\n=======\n\nIn 216595.1 [Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25] we have 3 copies of the \n    Histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3)\nTwo of them are adjacent in a cluster.  I have no idea why.\n\n\n========\n\n\n\nIn Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155\n   Kineococcus radiotolerans SRS30216 \n   Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202 \n   Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680\n   Streptomyces coelicolor A3\n\n4c2 exists,  4c1 is missing (i.e., the known form of 3.5.1.68 is missing),\nand a new gene clusters with the other genes in the pathway.  This leads me to the conjecture that\n\n    fig|246196.1.peg.1173 \n    fig|100226.1.peg.3034  -  uni|Q9KZ76\n    fig|1930.1.peg.4987\n    fig|227882.1.peg.3498  -   uni|Q82HL3\n    fig|247156.1.peg.2090  -    uni|Q5YXZ5\n    fig|313589.3.peg.4052  -   \n    fig|266940.1.peg.2198  -  gi|67987174\n    fig|267747.1.peg.2108  -   uni|Q6A5U0\n\nare all an alternative form of 4c1 which I have annotated as\n\n    N-formylglutamate deformylase (EC 3.5.1.68) [alternative form]\n\n===============\n\nIn the pseudomonads, you have a duplicated histidine-ammonia lyase and an embedded ABC\ntransport cassette.  I believe that the histidine-ammonia lyase is often monomeric \n(tetrameric??), so multiple copies of this within the same cluster is understandable.\n\nThe situation in Brucella is much stranger.  Here the histidine-ammonia lyase seems to\nhave split, with the leftmost portion fused to imidazolonepropionase, and the rightmost \nportion existing separately.  I have no idea how the subunits make up a complex in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]},

        "description":"Cyanophycin is a water-insoluble reserve polymer of multi-L-arginyl-poly-L-aspartic acid originally discovered in cyanobacteria. The protein-like polymer serves as a temporary nitrogen reserve, which accumulates during the transition from the exponential- to the stationary-growth phase and disappears when balanced growth resumes. The polymer contains aspartic acid and arginine in an equimolar ratio. The amino acids are arranged in a unique structure: the aspartic acid residues form a poly-(alpha-aspartate) backbone, with their beta-carboxyl groups linked to the alpha-amino groups of arginine residues by isopeptide bonds. At neutral pH and physiological ionic strength, the cyanobacterial cyanophycin is insoluble and accumulates in granules, but it is soluble in diluted acids and bases. Cyanophycin from non-cyanobacterial eubacteria has been found to be highly water-soluble.\n\nCyanophycin synthase catalyzes the ATP-dependent polymerization of arginine and aspartate non-ribosomally in an ATP-dependent elongation reaction. \nCyanophycinase, an exopeptidase, depolymerizes cyanophycin by hydrolysis of the alpha-peptide bonds between the aspartate residues of the backbone to yield beta-aspartyl-arginine\n",

        "notes":["  The genes that code for the enzymes of glycerophospholipid synthesis are scattered around the chromosome. With the exception of phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase (pgp), it appears that there is only a single structural gene coding for each enzyme. While control at the level of transcription may occur, there is no evidence for the clustering of related biosynthetic genes into operons (Ref.1).\r\n========================================================================\r\n  PlsY/PlsX pathway is an alternative route to a single enzyme PlsB. Apparently PlsY/PlsX/PlsC pathway and not PlsB/PlsC is the most common route to form one of the most important precursor of all phospholipids in all bacteria.\r\n\r\n=====PlsX/PlsY pathway � alternative acyltransferase system (for bacteria lacking plsB):====\r\n\r\n  This is a two-step pathway that utilizes a new fatty acid intermediate for the initiation of phospholipid formation. First, PlsX produces a unique activated fatty acid by catalyzing the synthesis of fatty acyl-phosphate from acyl-acyl carrier protein, and then PlsY transfers the fatty acid from acyl-phosphate to the 1-position of G3P. The PlsX/Y pathway defines the most widely distributed pathway for the initiation of phospholipid formation in bacteria and represents a new target for the development of antibacterial therapeutics.\r\n\r\n   From Paoletti L, Lu YJ, Schujman GE, de Mendoza D, Rock CO. �Coupling of fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis in Bacillus subtilis� (2007)(Ref.7):\r\n\r\n   plsX (acyl-acyl carrier protein [ACP]:phosphate acyltransferase), plsY (yneS) (acyl-phosphate:glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase), and plsC (yhdO) (acyl-ACP:1-acylglycerol-phosphate acyltransferase) function in phosphatidic acid formation, the precursor to membrane phospholipids. The physiological functions of these genes was inferred from their in vitro biochemical activities, and this study investigated their roles in gram-positive phospholipid metabolism through the analysis of conditional knockout strains in the Bacillus subtilis model system. The depletion of PlsX led to the cessation of both fatty acid synthesis and phospholipid synthesis. The inactivation of PlsY also blocked phospholipid synthesis, but fatty acid formation continued due to the appearance of acylphosphate intermediates and fatty acids arising from their hydrolysis. Phospholipid synthesis ceased following PlsC depletion, but fatty acid synthesis continued at a high rate, leading to the accumulation of fatty acids arising from the dephosphorylation of 1-acylglycerol-3-P followed by the deacylation of monoacylglycerol. Analysis of glycerol 3-P acylation in B. subtilis membranes showed that PlsY was an acylphosphate-specific acyltransferase, whereas PlsC used only acyl-ACP as an acyl donor. PlsX was found in the soluble fraction of disrupted cells but was associated with the cell membrane in intact organisms. These data establish that PlsX is a key enzyme that coordinates the production of fatty acids and membrane phospholipids in B. subtilis.\r\n\r\n======== plsB===================================================\r\n\r\n The sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) acyltransferase catalyzes the first committed step in membrane phospholipid formation and acylates the 1-position of G3P with either acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) or acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. The G3P acyltransferase in Escherichia coli has been extensively studied and is the membrane-bound product of the plsB gene. Consistent with its position at the start of the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway, the PlsB protein functions as a sensor that monitors the metabolic state of the cell through its allosteric interactions with ATP and guanosine-3',5'-tetraphosphate to coordinate the rate of G3P acylation with macromolecular biosynthesis and cell growth\r\n\r\n======= Cardiolipin===========================================\r\n\r\n Cardiolipin is an anionic membrane phospholipid. It is present in the plasma membrane of bacteria, whilst, is a marker lipid of mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes. Along with phosphatidylglycerol, the anionic lipids are important for the biogenesis and function of the mitochondrial membrane.\r\n\r\n The difference of cardiolipin biosynthesis between bacteria and eukaryotes lies in the last step. Whereas in bacteria, two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol are condensed to form cardiolipin, in eukaryotes, cardiolipin is formed from one molecule of CDP-diacylglycerol and one molecule of phosphatidylglycerol. In all eukaryotes, cardiolipin biosynthesis occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane\r\n\r\n======= Phosphatidic acid==========================================\r\n\r\nPhosphatidic acid (PtdOH) is an essential substrate for enzymes involved in the synthesis of glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols. PtdOH enters the biosynthetic pathway of phospholipids through a CTP-dependent activation catalyzed by CDP-diacylglycerol synthase. This enzyme forms CDP-diacylglycerol, which serves as a direct precursor for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro) and cardiolipin (di-PtdGro). In yeast, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is also formed from CDP-diacylglycerol, whereas PtdSer of mammalian cells is synthesized by head-group exchange of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) or phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). PtdSer can be decarboxylated to PtdEtn which is finally converted to PtdCho by three methylation steps\r\n\r\nPhosphatidic acid (PtdOH) is a key intermediate in glycerolipid biosynthesis. Two different pathways are known for de novo formation of this compound, namely (a) the Gro3P (glycerol 3-phosphate) pathway, and (b) the GrnP (dihydroxyacetone phosphate) pathway. Whereas the former route of PtdOH synthesis is present in bacteria and all types of eukaryotes, the GrnP pathway is restricted to yeast and mammalian cells.\r\n\r\nThe plsB gene of E. coli encodes a 83-kDa. The enzymatic activity of Gro3P AT was found to be firmly associated with the inner membrane of E. coli with the active site facing the cytosol. Only a small part of this protein, if any, traverses the membrane bilayer.\r\nThe enzyme catalyzing the second acylation step during PtdOH formation in E. coli, 1-acyl-Gro3P AT, is encoded by the plsC gene. In contrast to Gro3P AT, 1-acyl-Gro3P AT has a molecular mass of only 25 kDa, although both enzymes catalyze essentially the same type of reaction. Because the Gro3P AT reaction is the rate limiting step in Phosphatidic acid biosynthesis, it has been speculated that the larger size of the enzyme may allow the binding of effectors necessary for balanced PtdOH production.\r\n\r\n================NOTES:==========================================\r\n\r\n  It is possible that gpsA, glpA, and glpD are able to perform the same function, therefore presence of one of the above enzymes complete the pathway.\r\nNote: cdh, according to the KEGG map reversed the formation of CDP-diacylglycerol. Absence of that enzyme does not influence the formation major glycerophospholipids such as: Cardiolipin, phosphatidyl-glycerophosphate; phosphatidyl-l-Serine, and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine.\r\n\r\nALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE(EC 1.2.1.3)\r\n\r\n- Is very similar to Aldehyde Dehydrogenase B (EC 1.2.1.22) in Salmonella and certain \r\nspecies of Escherichia and Yersinia. \r\n- homologous to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.9) in Streptomyces, \r\nstreptococcus, clostridium\r\n--> This may mean that within these organisms,  aldehyde dehydrogenase is playing \r\ntwo functional roles. \r\n- does not appear in Borrelia, Cambylobacter, Thermatoga, Desulfovibrio (no homlogues \r\nfound)\r\n\r\n======Abbreviations for Glicerophospholipid pathway products:=========\r\n\r\nCardiolipin - Cdl  \r\nPhosphatidyl-Glycerophosphate - PGP\r\nPhosphatidyl-l-Serine - PS\r\nPhosphatidyl-Ethanolamine - PE\r\nPhosphatidyl-Glycerol - PG\r\n\r\n==========REFERENCES:==================================\r\n\r\n1.

        "subsystem_id":"Cardiolipin_biosynthesis",
        "description":"Cardiolipin is the trivial name (derived from the fact that it was first found in animal hearts, where it is especially abundant) for a lipid that should be correctly termed 'diphosphatidylglycerol' or 1,3-bis(sn-3'-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol. It is a unique phospholipid with in essence a dimeric structure, having four acyl groups and potentially carrying two negative charges. It is found almost exclusively in certain membranes of bacteria (plasma membrane and hydrogenosomes) and of mitochondria of eukaryotes, i.e. those membranes whose function is to generate an electrochemical potential for substrate transport and ATP synthesis. Because of this unique structure, cardiolipin is able to form micellar, lamellar, and hexagonal states in aqueous dispersions, depending on pH and ionic strength. It is believed to exist mainly in a bilayer state in natural membranes, with the two phosphatidylglycerols of cardiolipin oriented perpendicular to the bilayer surface and the central glycerol group oriented at the water/membrane interface and parallel to it. However, there may remain a tendency of cardiolipin to form transient non-bilayer domains, which could have a profound influence on its function in vital cellular processes. \n\nWhile the eukaryotic mitochondria require a constant level of cardiolipin for baseline activity,  prokaryotes accumulate cardiolipin only in specific situations. Cardiolipin has been shown to increase in the stationary phase (Hiraoka et al., 1993), in response to energy deprivation (PMID: 6697992), and in response to osmotic stress (PMID: 15554714). Accordingly, the expression level of cardiolipin synthase and its catalytic activity increase when Escherichia coli cultures reach the stationary phase (PMID: 17504273; Hiraoka et al., 1993).\n\nReferences:\n\nSchlame M1. 2008.

        "notes":["The biosynthetic pathway to cardiolipin is similar to that of other phospholipids in that it passes through the common intermediates, phosphatidic acid and then cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, the final step is a unique reaction, which is very different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the latter, it is the only phospholipid that is not synthesised on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum but in the mitochondrion.\n\nIn prokaryotes, Cardiolipin synthases ClsA, ClsB, or ClsC catalyse a transfer of the phosphatidyl moiety of one phosphatidylglycerol to the free 3'-hydroxyl group of another, with the elimination of one molecule of glycerol, via the action of an enzyme related to phospholipase D. In effect, transphosphatidylation occurs with one phosphatidylglycerol acting as a donor and the other an acceptor of a phosphatidyl moiety. The enzyme can operate in reverse under some physiological conditions to remove cardiolipin. The biosynthesis of cardiolipin is regulated via that of phosphatidylglycerol.\n\nIn eukaryotes, most Actinobacteria (PMID:19439403), and possibly in other bacterial taxa (as predicted in PMID:22409430) the first step in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin is the formation of phosphatidylglycerolphosphate, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol. The cardiolipin synthase Cls-II of \"eukaryotic type\", a phosphatidyl transferase, then links phosphatidylglycerol to diacylglycerol phosphate from the activated phosphatidyl moiety cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, with elimination of cytidine monophosphate (CMP). The enzymes from all species examined in detail require certain divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+ or Co2+) together with a high pH (8 to 9).  These enzymes belong to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase superfamily and are annotated here as \"Cardiolipin synthase (CMP-forming), eukaryotic type Cls-II (EC 2.7.8.41)\"\n"],

        "description":" Major terpenoid building blocks, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), are produced via two different biosynthetic routes: in some species by the so-called mevalonate pathway, and in others by the non-mevalonate or DOXP pathway. Both pathways produce the same key building blocks (IPP and DMAPP), essential in all forms of cellular life. They have apparently involved completely independently, and they share only one enzyme � Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IPDDI). Historically the mevalonate pathway and its enzymes were thoroughly studied in eukaryotes. Some bacteria also use mevalonate pathway, and all of the corresponding genes were identified based on homology with eukaryotic counterparts [Ref.2,3].  Although usually bacteria have only one of the two pathways, there are exceptions: Listeria has boths. Plants also have both, but one of them (DOXP) is of plastid (bacterial) origin. All other eukaryotes and archaea appear to have only mevalonate pathway. ISPC seems to be a missing gene in Brucella ssp. Reconstruction of the mevalonate pathway in archaea including conjectures for some locally missing genes was described [Ref.4]. The alternative DOXP pathway, characteristic of most bacteria was not recognized until very recently (for a review see [Ref.5]), and some aspects of it remained obscure until recently [Ref.6,7]. \r\n\r\nThis subsystem shows just the nonmevalonate component of isoprenoid biosynthesis.\r\n \r\n",

        "description":"In mitochondria and most aerobic bacteria, oxidative pyruvate decarboxylation, a central step in energy metabolism, is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex.  In archaea, most anaerobic bacteria, and amitochondriate eukaryotes, this reaction is catalyzed reversibly by a single enzyme, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), the electron acceptor being either ferredoxin or flavodoxin.  The enzyme contains [4Fe-4S] clusters and thiamine pyrophosphate.  In strictly anaerobic microorganisms PFOR is involved in substrate-level phosphorylation.  In many nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, it is the source of low-potential electrons for nitrogenase, whereas in acetogenic bacteria like  Clostridium thermoaceticum, it links glycolysis to the Wood�Ljungdahl pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis.  \n\nIn contrast to pyruvate dehydrogenase, PFOR can also catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e., the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA provided that a sufficiently low-potential electron donor (like ferredoxin) is  available.  It has been reported for many obligatory anaerobes, including some photosynthetic bacteria, and more recently for an extremely thermophilic aerobic microorganism.  This reverse reaction is important for  some autotrophs because it serves to assimilate CO2 into  cell carbon.  \n\nHypothetical NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases tend to cluster with both types of PFOR, they are encoded in this SS as auxiliary roles (AUX).\n",

Their high affinity for oxygen may allow human pathogens to colonize anoxic tissues, and agronomically important diazotrophs to sustain N2 fixation.\r\n\r\nThe ccoNOQP operon encoding cbb3 oxidase subunits is generally found close to a second gene cluster, known as ccoGHIS (fixGHIS) whose expression is necessary for the assembly of a functional cbb3  oxidase (Preisig et al., 1996; Koch et al., 2000).  The ccoGHIS products appear to be remarkably specific to the cyt cbb3 oxidases.  \r\n\r\nCcoG might be involved in intracellular oxidation of Cu+ (which is probably the transported form of this metal) to it�s biologically utilized Cu+2 form (Koch et al., 2000).  This might be important at low-oxygen tensions.  CcoG contains two Cys-rich motifs resembling those in 4Fe-4S-containing ferredoxin molecules.\r\n\r\nCcoI is homologous to CPx-type ATP-dependent metal ion transporters and is believed to play a role in the uptake and metabolism of copper required for the assembly of the  dinuclear centre of cytochrome cbb3 oxidase (Preisig et al., 1996)\r\n\r\nCcoH contains no characteristic motifs leaving it�s roles completely unknown. �Rhizobium type� CcoH is missing from a characteristic ccoGIS cluster in many species.  Notably, members of another protein family (COG3198), completely unrelated to CcoH at a sequence level, are present in some of these species.  Their tight clustering with ccoGIS genes and peculiar occurrence profile [present only if: (i) genes encoding components of cyt cbb3 oxidase are present AND (ii) CcoH homolog is missing in a genome] makes COG3198 a likely candidate for a non-orthologous gene displacement event.   COG3198 was annotated �Putative analog of CcoH, COG3198�\r\n\r\nCcoS is essential for the production of active cbb3, without it the complete cbb3 apoenzyme is present in the membranes, but has no activity due to the absence of b-type hemes and Cu cofactors of I subunit (cytochromes Cp and cyt Co are present in subunits II and III, which probably mature independently via cyt C maturation pathway).  Primary role of CcoS may be insertion of the b-type heme groups into cytochrome cbb3 oxidases (Koch et al., 2000).\r\n\r\nVariant codes:\r\n\r\n1:  complete set of CcoGHIS homologs is present in an organism \r\n2: the CcoGHIS cluster is missing a CcoH homolog, �Putative analog of CcoH, COG3198� is present instead \r\n3: the CcoGHIS cluster is missing a CcoH homolog, but no other candidate for this role is suggested\r\n-1: no known factors of cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis can be identified in a genome, and no cbb3 subunits are present as well (check �show -1 variants� to display)\r\n9: no (or very few) known factors of cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis can be identified in a genome, while structural subunits of this oxidase are present.

We report  \r\nthe discovery of an evolutionarily conserved 17.4 kDa protein, here  \r\nnamed RraA (regulator of ribonuclease activity A) that binds to RNase  \r\nE and inhibits RNase E endonucleolytic cleavages without altering  \r\ncleavage site specificity or interacting detectably with substrate  \r\nRNAs. Overexpression of RraA circumvents the effects of an  \r\nautoregulatory mechanism that normally maintains the RNase E cellular  \r\nlevel within a narrow range, resulting in the genome-wide  \r\naccumulation of RNase E-targeted transcripts. While not required for  \r\nRraA action, the C-terminal RNase E region that serves as a scaffold  \r\nfor formation of a multiprotein degradosome complex modulates the  \r\ninhibition of RNase E catalytic activity by RraA.

It is derived from chorismate by seven enzymes in Escherichia coli. However, a bioinformatic analysis of whole genome sequences has suggested that some microorganisms, including pathogenic species such as Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, do not have orthologs of the men genes, even though they synthesize menaquinone. We deduced the outline of this alternative pathway in a nonpathogenic strain of Streptomyces by bioinformatic screening, gene knockouts, shotgun cloning with isolated mutants, and in vitro studies with recombinant enzymes. As humans and commensal intestinal bacteria, including lactobacilli, lack this pathway, it represents an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics.\n\n\nMenaquinone via futalosine step 1\nspeaks for itself\n\n5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.16)\nmany of these should become\nMenaquinone via futalosine step 2\n\n\n7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin synthase-related protein (cluster B)\nbecame\nMenaquinone via futalosine step 3\n\n\n7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin synthase-related protein (cluster A)\nbecame\nGene SCO4494, often clustered with other genes in menaquinone via futalosine pathway\n\n\nThe following are all here because they are frequently clustered, and are apt to play similar roles in this pathway as they would in Ubiquinone biosynthesis:\n\nUbiA -- 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.-)\nUbiD -- 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (EC 4.1.1.-)\nUbiX -- 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase UbiX (EC 4.1.1.-)\n\n\n\n\n"],

        "description":"This Subsystem focuses on implementaion of glycolysis and glyconeogenesis in Archaea (the corresponding processes in Eubacteria are encoded in SS �Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis�.  This SS has been initiated by Ross Overbeek and is currently curated by Svetlana Gerdes.  \r\n\r\nGlycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) in Archaea differs significantly from that in bacteria and eukaryotes.  Just a few striking examples:\r\n-- zero or very low ATP yields\r\n-- many unusual glycolytic enzymes, including ADP-dependent gluco- and phosphofructo- kinases, non-orthologous PGMs, FBAs, non-phosphorylating GAP dehydrogenases, etc.\r\n-- reduction of ferredoxin rather than NADH, etc\r\n\r\nNotably, much less variation is observed in glyconeogenic enzymes.  This probably reflects the independent evolution of catabolic branches in bacteria and archaea diverging from originally glyconeogenic EMP pathway (refs. 2, 5) .  Since studies of archaeal glycolytic pathways have started only in early 1990s, a large number of open questions (including �missing� enzymes) remains.  A diagram of archaeal EMP/glyconeogenesis pathway is posted on SEED Forum at: http://brucella.uchicago.edu/SubsystemForum/showthread.php?p=357#post357\r\n\r\nOut of 10 enzymatic steps, which constitute classical EMP 7 are reversible and work in glyconeogenesis as well.  However, glycolytic reactions catalyzed by the following enzymes are not reversible: \r\n(i) 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), \r\n(ii) Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), \r\n(iii) some forms of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (see below) \r\nThey are bypassed during glyconeogenesis via:\r\n(i) Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), \r\n(ii) PEP synthase (EC 2.7.9.2) or/and Pyruvate,phosphate dikinase (EC 2.7.9.1), \r\n(iii) NAD(P)-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase \r\nrespectively or by utilizing other central metabolic pathways\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nRossO: I highly recommend Verhees doctoral thesis -\r\n1.\"Molecular characterization of glycolysis in Pyrococcus furiosus\", for his discussions of what is going on in the Archaea.

        "notes":["Multi-positional encoding of variant codes was utilized here in order to capture (at least a fraction of!) endless variations of EMP and glyconeogenesis in different species of Archaea. \r\n\r\nVariant code = -1:\r\n(i) assigned to all eubacteria, since this SS is focused on Archaea (please see SS: Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis for eubacteria)\r\n(ii) assignd to Archaea, if the majority of enzymes are absent, no functional EPM/glyconeogenesis can be asserted, as it is the case in Nanoarchaeum equitans Kin4-M\r\n\r\nA star(s) in a variant code indicates that one or more enzymes expected to be present in the genome based on functional context could not be identified (�missing genes�).\r\n  \r\nFIRST digit reflects the type of a sugar kinase catalyzing formation of glucose-6-P in an organism:\r\n\r\n1 = an ATP-dependent hexo- or glucokinase(s) is present \r\n3 = an ADP-dependent glucokinase is present\r\n8 = different types of kinases (ADP - ATP- , or PPi-dependent) can be asserted in an organism\r\n9 = no sugar kinase could be identified.  Glucokinases are �missing� enzymes in several  saccharolytic archaea, which lack a potential bypass - GDH channeling glucose into non-phosphorylating ED, and hence, are expected to have functional Glk, including: Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanococcus maripaludis.  Their variant codes have a star.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND digit reflects a type of 6-phosphofructokinase (Pfk) present:\r\n\r\n1 = ATP-dependent Pfk is present (one or several types)\r\n2 = PPi-dependent Pfk is present. ATP yield of glycolysis is higher in this case.\r\n3 = an ADP-dependent Pfk is present \r\n8 = different types of kinases (ADP - ATP- , or PPi-dependent) can be asserted\r\n9 = no ortholog of known PFKs can be detected in a genome.  In the majority of these organisms the presence of glucose 1-dehydrogenase (GDH, included in this SS) catalyzing the first step of alternative pathways of glucose catabolism indicates that archaeal Entner-Doudoroff and/or Pentose Phosphate pathways are used in place of glycolysis.  This is the apparently the case in: Ferroplasma acidarmanus, Picrophilus torridus, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, Haloarcula marismortui, and all sequenced species of Sulfolobus and Thermoplasma.  The absence of both enzymes - Pfk and GDH in an organism is characteristic of autotrophs Methanopyrus kandleri and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, unable to utilize hexoses and apparently lacking internal glycogen cycle (accumulating cyclic 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate instead).  On the other hand, Pfk is expected to be present, but is not found (�missing� gene) in genomes of Pyrobaculum aerophilum and Archaeoglobus fulgidus\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD digit reflects the presence/absence of Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, archaeal class I:\r\n\r\n1 = FBA, archaeal class I can be asserted\r\n9 = FBA is missing.  Note, that Archaeal class I FBA is a divergent family, difficult to separate from other aldolases.  Tried to pick only one paralog per genome (but Methanosarcinas apparently have 2 legitimate copies � at least by clustering) � see notes on enzymes\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH digit reflects a type of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) present:\r\n\r\n1 = a single universal GAPD(P)H apparently acts in both directions - in glycolysis AND glyconeogenesis\r\n4 = two distinct enzymes: GAPDHs catalyze 1,3-bisP-glycerate &#8594; glyceraldehyde-3P conversion in glyconeogenesis, while GAPOR or/and G3PNPa catalyze irreversible oxidation of glyceraldehyde-P to glycerate-3P in the direction of glycolysis.  ATP yield of glycolysis is zero in this case \r\n9 = no GAPDH.  Extremely rare � occurs only in species missing EMP/glyconeogenic pathway completely (e.g. Nanoarchaeum equitans Kin4-M)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo keep variant encoding as simple as possible, the following variations of EMP/glycolysis have NOT been reflected in variant codes, but should be kept in mind:\r\n\r\n5. the presence/ absence of some form of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP), required for glyconeogenesis.  Note: It is not clear, whether bifunctional FBP/myoinositol-1-phosphatase (COG0483) proposed for the role of FBP in archaea earlier (e.g. MJ0109, ref 4) does indeed function as FBP.  \r\nCONTRA: (i) the phenotypes of FBP knockouts generated in Thermococcus kodakaraensis (ref 3); \r\n       (ii) occurence profile: three other forms of FBP nicely cover phylogenetic space in Archaea.\r\nPRO: (i) the presence of FBP activity in vitro in MJ0109 (ref 4), \r\n     (ii) MJ0109 (COG0483) clusters with pyruvate kinase, and in the Methanosarcinia COG0483 clusters with  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphae dehydrogenase, \r\n     (iii) COG0483 homolog (peg.1400) seems to be the only likely FBP in Thermotoga maritima.\r\n\r\n6. While several archaea contain orthologs of classical glucose-6P isomerase (Pgi), others posses one of the two archaeal enzymes (unrelated to bacterial Pgi on sequence level).  The exceptions are - Methanopyrus kandleri AV19 and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus str. Delta H (see above)\r\n\r\n7. Archaea have their own class I FBA, unrelated to bacterial FBA I on the sequence level, but with the same Shiff base mechanism. The majority of archaeal genomes sequenced to date contain at least one gene homolog.  Clear FBA homolog are missing in the genomes of Pyrobaculum  aerophilum, Ferroplasma acidarmanus, Thermoplasma acidophilum and Thermoplasma volcanium, Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790.  In addition, in the following genomes none of the �aldolase of the DhnA family� homologs, albeit present, were annotated as FBA:  Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSM 4304, Methanopyrus kandleri AV19, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus.  These proteins appear to be phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolases, rather then FBAs - based on (i) the strong clustering with other chorismate biosynthesis genes and on (ii) the absence of all other known types of phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase in these genomes.  They are currently annotated in SEED as �Alternative step 1 of chorismate biosynthesis�\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The presence/absence of Pyruvate kinase (PyK) acting in the direction of glycolysis. No clear orthologs of PyK could be asserted in the genomes of: Methanopyrus kandleri AV19 and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSM 4304\r\n\r\n\r\nA note of caution: in unfinished genomes any �9� in variant code should be taken with a grain of salt.  The gene may be as well present � but could have been missed or fragmented beyond recognition by an ORF-calling program.  A DNA BLAST against the genome of interest is recommended.  The state of completeness for each genome can be assessed from the FIG Search page � look at the window �If You Need to Pick a Genome for Options Below�.

Under construction\r\n\r\nQuoted from PMID: 16835730: \"Class II chelatases are defined as metal-inserting enzymes that are homomeric and do not require ATP for activity. The metal chelation reactions catalyzed by these enzymes all encompass the following basic steps: the puckering of the pyrrole ring(s), metal ion insertion, and deprotonation of the pyrrole nitrogens. The structures of several chelatases of this class have been reported, including the protoporphyrin ferrochelatase (HemH) from Bacillus substilis (bFc), human (hFc) and yeast (yFc), cobaltochelatase (CbiK) from Salmonella enterica.\r\n\r\nThe Class II chelatases include CbiX(long) (long version of CbiX) and CbiX(short) (short version of CbiX), cobaltochelatases of vitamin B12 biosynthesis, sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase SirB of siroheme synthesis, and protoporphyrin ferrochelatase (HemH) of heme biosynthesis. The sequence identity among these chelatases is low, yet they share extensive structural similarity and spatial arrangement of active site residues. CbiX(long) and SirB share approximately 60% similarity but the CbiX(long) proteins contain a C-terminal extension that includes both a histidine-rich region and an Fe�S center. The length of CbiXS proteins typically is about half the size of the long versions of CbiX. CbiX(long) and CbiK are likely to have arisen from gene duplication and fusion events involving cbiX(short). Some, but not all, CbiX(short) proteins contain a histidine-rich region but none are thought to harbor any Fe�S centers\"\r\n",

        "description":"Fe-S cluster assembly\r\n\r\n  Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins are present in all living organisms and play important roles in electron transport and metalloenzyme catalysis [1]. Although Fe-S clusters can be assembled into proteins in vitro from Fe2+ and S2, it is clear that in vivo, this process mus tbe facilitated by protein factors to avoid accumulation of Fe2+ and S2 to toxic levels. The complex, multi-step process involved in the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters is only now being clarified, and early work has identified three distinct systems termed NIF (nitrogen fixation), ISC (iron-sulfur cluster), and SUF (sulfur mobilization).      NifS-NifU are required for the assembly of Fe-S clusters of the nitrogenase proteins in Azotobacter vinelandii [2]. NifS is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase that initiates Fe-S cluster formation by eliminating elemental sulfur from cysteine and transferring it to NifU, which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of Fe-S clusters prior to their delivery to apo�Fe-S protein targets.    In contrast to the NIF machinery that specifically deals with the maturation of nitrogenase, the ISC proteins are involved in the general biosynthesis pathway for numerous Fe-S proteins [3]. In several bacteria, the genes encoding these Fe-S assembly proteins (IscS, IscU, IscA, Hsc66, Hsc20, and ferredoxin) are organized in a cluster, iscSUA-hscBA-fdx. Mutation of these genes in Escherichia coli decreases the activity of many Fe-S proteins, whereas overexpression of the operon leads to increased production of Fe-S proteins [4]. \r\n   A third system (SUF) encoded by the sufABCDSE operon represents a minor pathway for the assembly of Fe-S clusters [5]. In an E. coli mutant from which the entire isc operon was deleted, the activity of Fe-S proteins was only 2�10% that in wild-type cells. The residual activity may arise from the contribution of the SUF system, since overexpression of the suf operon restores the growth phenotype and activity of Fe-S proteins in mutant cells lacking the ISC machinery. Disruption of the suf operon does not cause any major defects, whereas the loss of both the ISC and SUF systems leads to synthetic lethality. \r\nSeveral similarities have been found among the NIF, ISC, and SUF systems. IscS and SufS are structurally similar to NifS, and all three function as a cysteine desulfurase [6]. IscU is homologous to the N-terminal domain of NifU and contains three conserved cysteine  residues that are essential for its function as a scaffold for intermediate Fe-S clusters [7]. SufA and IscA are members of the HesB protein family that binds iron and [2Fe-2S] clusters, and mediates iron delivery for assembly of Fe-S clusters in IscU [8]. The ISC machinery contains three additional components, two essential chaperones HscB and HscA, and nonessential [2Fe-2S]ferredoxin Fdx. The biochemical properties of the SUF-specific components are less well understood. SufE interacts with SufS and stimulates its cysteine desulfurase activity [9]. The SufB, SufC and SufD proteins associate in a stable complex, and SufC has been shown to possess ATPase activity in this context [10].\r\nMutational analysis has demonstrated that the ISC system predominantly functions in the biosynthesis of Fe-S proteins, whereas the SUF system contributes only modestly [11]. The expression of the suf operon is controlled by OxyR and Fur, suggesting a stress response function for the SUF machinery under conditions of oxidative stress (when FeS clusters are damaged) and iron limitation [12].\r\nRecent functional replacement study of E.coli isc-suf double mutant showed that nifSU-like genes cloned from Helicobacter pylori are functionally exchangeable with the isc and suf operons under anaerobic conditions [13]. Thus, at least some NIF-like systems participates in the maturation of a wide variety of Fe-S proteins. However, the NIF system was only found in a limited number of bacterial species, most of which are anaerobes.\r\n\r\nAdditional Functional Roles:\r\n#IscR: Iron-sulfur cluster regulator is encoded by an ORF located immediately upstream of the isc operon coding for the Escherichia coli Fe-S cluster assembly proteins. IscR belongs to COG1959, which is also contains the nitrite-sensitive repressor NsrR from Nitrosomonas and its orthologs from other proteobacteria (D.R., unpublished observation). \r\nIscR functions as a repressor of the iscRSUA operon. Analysis of IscR by electron paramagnetic resonance showed that the anaerobically isolated protein contains a [2Fe-2S](1+) cluster. The Fe-S cluster appears to be important for IscR function, because repression of iscR expression is significantly reduced in strains containing null mutations of the Fe-S cluster assembly genes iscS or hscA. It suggests that this protein may be part of a novel autoregulatory mechanism that senses the Fe-S cluster assembly status of cells.\r\n#HscA and HscB: Hsc66 and Hsc20 comprise a specialized chaperone system important for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in Escherchia coli. Only a single substrate, the Fe/S template protein IscU, has been identified for the Hsc66/Hsc20 system, but the mechanism by which Hsc66 selectively binds IscU is unknown . HscA is similar to the heat shock protein 70 DnaK.\r\n#Fdx: The ferredoxin Fdx could function as an intermediate site for Fe-S cluster assembly \r\n#SufC: is an atypical cytoplasmic ABC-ATPase, which forms a complex with SufB and SufD; \r\n#SufE: forms a complex with SufS and the binding of SufE to SufS is responsible for a 50-fold stimulation of the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1.\tBeinert, H., Holm, R.H., and M�nck, E.

AP-3. The complete nucleotide sequence of this region was determined and six genes were found downstream of amnBA. The eight genes together were designated amnBACFEDHG. Each gene was similar to the corresponding gene operating in the meta-cleavage pathway, except for amnB, amnA, and amnD. The four 2-aminophenol-metabolizing enzymes, 2-aminomuconic 6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, 2-aminomuconate deaminase, 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase, and 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase, were purified and characterized. NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of each purified enzyme agreed with those deduced from amnC, amnF, amnE, and amnD, respectively. These genes were therefore assigned as the genes encoding these respective proteins. The tight clustering of the amn genes, which were all transcribed in the same direction, raised the possibility that these genes formed a single operon. The organization of the amn genes was entirely different from that of the atd, dmp, and xyl genes reported in the meta-cleavage pathway, although these latter genes clustered similarly.\r\n\r\nPMID: 11081795\r\n\r\n"],

This case has been experimentally documented in yeast, which are lacking ALDC and Acetoin-DH, but posses a well studied 2,3-BDH (Gonzales et al., 2000). Potential explanations:\r\n(i) The function of 2,3-BDH in these organisms can be utilization of acetoin produced as a side product by other enzymes (e.g. pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast (Chen GC, Jordan, 1984)), and/or utilization of diacetyl (originating from non-enzymatic decarboxylation of a-acetolactate (Boumerdassi et al., 1996)).  The later could be first converted to acetoin (via diacetyl reductase activity inherent for many 2,3-BDHs) and then to 2,3-BD. \r\n(ii) nonorthologous  variants of ALDC or Acetoin-DH are present in these organisms (�missing genes�)\r\n(iii) the presence of 2,3-BDH is due to erroneous overannotation \r\n\r\nProblem #2\r\nS. cerevisiae could grow on 2,3-butanediol as the sole carbon and energy source (Gonzales et al., 2000).  Under these conditions, a 3.5-fold increase in (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase activity was observed in the total cell extracts�.(Gonzales et al., 2000).

        "description":"I. Synthesis of acetoin and butanediol (acetoin, butanediol fermentation)\r\n\r\nIn some bacteria, pyruvate can be channeled via alpha-acetolactate and acetoin into the neutral compound 2,3-butanediol, the production of which is induced when oxygen is limited and the pH is lowered.  The metabolic function of the 2,3-butanediol pathway is believed to be that of preventing intracellular acidification by changing the metabolism from acid production to the formation of neutral compounds.  In addition to controlling the pH, the butanediol pathway participates in the regulation of the NADH-NAD ratio. Large amounts of NAD are regenerated from NADH during glucose degradation, as acetoin is reduced to 2,3-butanediol.  After glucose exhaustion, when NADH is not formed, this reaction is reversed, and extracellular 2,3-butanediol acts as a reservoir of reducing equivalents.  Three enzymes are involved in the 2,3-butanediol pathway: \r\nAcetolactate synthase, catabolic (EC 2.2.1.6) catalyses formation of acetolactate from pyruvate.  Acetolactate is decarboxylated by Alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) into acetoin, which in turn is reduced in a reversible reaction into 2,3- butanediol by 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH).  In some species this enzyme is also involved in irreversible reduction of diacetyl to acetoin [acetoin (diacetyl) reductase].  \r\nDiacetyl, a side product of this pathway, is produced nonenzymatically by oxidative decarboxylation of a-acetolactate (Boumerdassi et al., 1996).  Diacetyl has a strong, buttery flavor and yellow color and is essential at low concentrations in many dairy products, such as butter, butter- milk, and fresh cheeses. It is also considered to be the most important off-flavor in the brewing process and in the wine industry (Hugenholtz et al., 2000).\r\n\r\nNote:  In addition to catabolic Acetolactate synthase (ALS_c),  anabolic Acetolactate synthase, involved in the valine-leucine and isoleucine pathways (see SS: Branched-Chain Amino Acid Biosynthesis) has been included in this SS as an auxiliary role (to help disambiguate different types of Acetolactate synthases).  In addition, other TPP �dependent enzymes paralogous to ALS have been included � for the same reason (they are grouped into Subset �Auxilary roles� together with several hypothetical genes they often co-localize with). \r\n\r\nII. Acetoin, butanediol utilization\r\n\r\nAcetoin can be (re)utilized during stationary phase when other carbon sources have been depleted by many bacterial species.  The key reaction of the fermentative breakdown of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) is the thiamine PPi (TPP)-, coenzyme A-, and NAD-dependent cleavage of acetoin into acetaldehyde and acetyl coenzyme A, which is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase (AcDH) enzyme system (Huang et al., 1999).  In addition to the structural genes of the acetoin dehydrogenase (acoABCL), acoX (encoding a protein of unknown function), and acoR (encoding a putative regulatory protein) are often localized in the same cluster.  Utilization of 2,3-butanediol requires in addition 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, which feeds the substrate to the acetoin dehydrogenase enzyme system.  Existence of enzymes other then AcDH utilizing acetoin can be predicted in yeast (see �Open Problems� below)\r\n\r\nIII. Stereo-specificity of 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase\r\n\r\nStereo-specificity of 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase is an industrially important issue.  The levoisomer of 2,3-butanediol is particularly sought after as an antifreeze agent due to its low freezing point. The compound can also be applied to the production of butadiene and liquid fuel (Voloch et al., 1984).  It is a rather complex issue, however, and almost impossible to assert based on protein sequence alone.  \r\nAll three stereoisomers of 2,3- butanediol can be produced by various microorganisms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter aerogenes, K. terrigena, ets.). Depending on the microorganism and the conditions of grown, the ratio of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) stereoisomers can vary dramatically.  It is believed, that (R)-acetoine is largely produced from pyruvate via alpha-acetolactate synthase and acetolactate decarboxylase pathway (L-acetoin production is rare and can be catalyzed, for example, by acetoin racemase postulated to exist in some organisms � role NOT associated with any sequence yet). Taylor and Juni (1960) proposed a model for the formation of all 2,3-BD stereoisomers based on the existence of only three enzymes: an acetoin racemase, L(+)-BD dehydrogenase and D(-)-BD dehydrogenase. In this model dehydrogenases are considered to be non-specific with respect to acetoin stereoisomers. That is, they would accept either acetoin isomer as substrate, but the reaction product would still be dependent on the acetoin isomer reduced.  For example, the L-( +)-dehydrogenase would reduce L-(+)-acetoin to L- (+)-2,3-BD and D-( -)-acetoin to meso-2,3-BD.  This assumption seems to be correct for some 2,3-BDHs studied so far (e.g. yeast BDH recognizes both R-acetoin and S-acetoin, yielding R-carbon in both cases (Gonzales et al., 2000)) but does NOT hold for others (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae BDH seems to recognize only R-acetoin (Ui et all., 1999), yielding R-alcohol) \r\nThe ability of the same enzyme to catalyze the reverse reaction of 2,3�butanediol oxidation to acetoin adds to the complexity.  Although the stereo-specificity for the R- and/or S-carbon holds, substrate preference (meso-BD vs R,R-2,3-BD) can differ, affecting the resultant product mix (Voloch et al., 1984).\r\nIn this SS an attempt was made to project stereo-specificity from well studied 2,3-BDHs (only three available) to all sequenced orthologs based on phylogenetic trees.  Understandably, mistakes are unavoidable and actual stereospecificity of individual enzymes can differ!  Assertions here have been based on the experimentally established stereo-specificity of the following enzymes:\r\n\r\n1.

Here, we characterize Tn7-generated mutations that induce the liaRS TCS. In addition to insertions in liaF, a known negative regulator of the LiaRS TCS, we identified two disruptions in the last two genes of the yydFGHIJ operon. This operon is predicted to encode a 49-amino-acid peptide (YydF), a modification enzyme (YydG), a membrane-embedded protease (YydH), and an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (YydIJ). Genome sequence comparisons suggest that the yydFGHIJ operon may have been acquired by horizontal transfer. Inactivation of the YydIJ transporter resulted in increased expression from the LiaR-dependent P(liaI) promoter only in the presence of the yydFGH genes. Cells harboring the complete yydFGHIJ operon induced LiaR activity in cocultured cells lacking either this transporter or the complete operon. These results suggest that this operon is involved in the synthesis and export of a modified peptide (YydF*) that elicits cell envelope stress sensed by the LiaRS TCS.\n\n\n",

The basal layer contains more than a dozen different proteins, while the nap is composed of filaments formed by a single collagen-like glycoprotein called BclA. Multiple copies of an O-linked pentasaccharide, 2-O-methyl-4-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutamido)-4,6-dideoxy-&#946;-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)-{alpha}-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->3)-{alpha}-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->?)-N-acetylgalactosamine , attached to several sites within the central collagen-like region of BclA. The unusual noreducing terminal sugar 2-O-methyl-4-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutamido)-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose is called anthrose. Anthrose is important in spore survival and propagation.\r\n\r\nThe genes for the biosynthesis of anthrose constitute a four-gene operon and an adjacent, downstream two-gene operon.\r\n\r\nThe pathway requires four dedicated enzymes and the initial substrates methylcrotonyl-CoA and dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-{alpha}-D-glucose, which are provided by leucine catabolism and L-rhamnose biosynthesis, respectively. A scheme is available under the \"Diagram and Illustration\" tab above (quoted from PMID:20675481). The two glycosyltransferases (one in each operon) may be involved in polymerization of the anthrose-containing pentasaccharide or its attachment to BclA.\r\nDeletion of the 4-gene operon abolished anthrose synthesis. Deletion of the two-gene operon did not have a significant effect on the anthrose content of spores, suggesting their activities can be carried out by other genes in the cell.\r\n\r\n",

Riboflavin availability influences the capacity of rhizobia to survive in the rhizosphere and to colonize roots. In this study, we identified the RL1692 gene of Rhizobium leguminosarum downstream of a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch. RL1692 encodes a putative transmembrane permease with two EamA domains. The presence of an FMN riboswitch regulating a transmembrane protein is usually observed in riboflavin transporters, suggesting that RL1692 may be involved in riboflavin uptake. The product of RL1692, which we named RibN, is conserved in members of the alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria and shares no significant identity with any riboflavin transporter previously identified. In this work, we show that RibN is localized in the membrane cellular fraction and its expression is downregulated by riboflavin. By heterologous expression in a Brucella abortus mutant auxotrophic for riboflavin, we demonstrate that RibN possesses flavin transport activity. Similarly, we also demonstrate that RibN orthologues from Ochrobactrum anthropi and Vibrio cholerae (which lacks the FMN riboswitch) are able to transport riboflavin. An R. leguminosarum ribN null mutant exhibited lower nodule occupancy levels in pea plants during symbiosis assays. Thus, we propose that RibN and its homologues belong to a novel family of riboflavin transporters. This work provides the first experimental description of riboflavin transporters in Gram-negative bacteria.\r\n\r\nPMID: 23935051 \n"],

Notably, genomes of these organisms encode uncharacterized multisubunit 2-oxoacid oxidoreductases (often in several gene copies) tentatively annotated in this database as \"2-oxoglutarate/2-oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.7.-)\" alpha-, beta- , gamma- and delta- subunits.

The 2-oxoglutarate oxidoreductase and related complexes oxidatively decarboxylate different 2-oxoacids to form their CoA derivatives (e.g. 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA) with concomitant reduction of ferredoxin.  We predict, that the presence of the bct-bck-like genes might indicate that these CoA derivatives are not assimilated, but rather 'burnt for energy' via a acylphosphotransferase/kinase system, analogous to the branched-chain acylphosphotransferase/kinase system (BCDH-bct-bck) described above\r\n\r\nReferences \r\n\r\nWard, D.

        "description":"This Subsystem (SS) encodes the utilization of Branched-chain amino acids and alpha-keto acids as energy sources only -- via a system analogous to a well-known pyruvate dehydrogenase plus phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase (PDH-pta-ackA) pathway to produce ATP. See another Subsystem: \"Degradation of branched-chain amino acids and alpha-keto acids\" for degradation and assimilation of branched-chain amino acids and alpha-keto acids as carbon sources.\r\n\r\nTwo auxiliary Roles specific for Butyrate (butanoate) metabolism are also included in this SS for disambiguation: \r\n- Phosphate butyryltransferase (EC 2.3.1.19)\r\n- Butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7)\r\nNote, that in some genomes the branched-chain specific genes bct and/or bck co-localize with the butyrate-specific genes\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\nThe Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCDH) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the branched-chain alpha-keto acids alpha-ketoisocaproic (KIC), alpha-ketoisovaleric (KIV), and alpha-keto-beta-methylvaleric acid (KMV), that can be are derived  either (i) from the transamination of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) or (ii) from the degradation of membrane lipids or (iii) from  the environment, via the uptake of branched-chain alpha-keto acids \r\n\r\nAn elegant and profound study by Ward at al. (PMID:10464218) pointed out that in genomes of Enterococcus faecalis (a member of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB)) and Bacillus subtilis  the BKDH complex is encoded in a gene cluster which also contains hypothetical genes for a branched-chain acyl-phosphotransferase and an acyl kinase.  This observation lead the authors to hypothesize and then to convincingly demonstrate that this cluster encodes a previously undescribed pathway in E. faecalis for the utilization of the branched-chain alpha-keto acids KIC, KIV, and KMV as energy sources. These compounds are reductively decarboxylated by the BKDH complex generating the corresponding acyl-CoA�s, which are then converted to the free acids isovalerate, isobutyrate, and methylbutyrate through the combined actions of the acyl-phosphotransferase and acyl kinase (the Bct and Bck gene products).  Importantly, the concomitant phosphorylation of ADP generates ATP in a system analogous to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plus phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase (PDH-pta-ackA).  Similar study has been published earlier in a spirochete (PMID:6288660)\r\n\r\nThe physiological role of the bkd-bct-bck  gene cluster in E. faecalis is to serve as an alternative energy source to enterococci, which are unable to synthesize heme and therefore lack functional electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation and rely on substrate-level phosphorylation for ATP generation. \r\n\r\nAn orthologous gene cluster is encoded in the genomes of a number of other Firmicutes, most notably in Bacillus subtilis (PMID: 10094682).  There it is involved in carbon and nitrogen  assimilation (in addition to energy production),  in contrast to the E. faecalis system, whose main function is most likely energy generation (see PMID:10464218 for detailed comparative analysis).  \r\n\r\nAnother important difference between the  E. faecalis and B.subtilis clusters is the absence in the former of the bcd gene, encoding Branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase [deaminating] (EC 1.4.1.9)(EC 1.4.1.23).  The absence of this enzyme from the E. faecalis bkd gene cluster may explain the organism�s inability to convert the branched-chain amino acids to the corresponding free acids (PMID:10464218).  Apparently the alpha-keto acids that are utilized for ATP generation via this cluster are not obtained by protein degradation but, rather, by degradation of membrane lipids or from the environment, as they apparently have a transport system for the branched- chain alpha-keto acids  (PMID:10464218).   \r\n\r\nThe presence of a deaminase, encoded by the bcd gene, in the bkd-bct-bck in many Firmicutes indicates that BOTH, branched-chain amino acids and alpha-keto acids, potentially can be utilized as energy (and carbon?) sources by these organisms.  This difference in captured in variant codes in this Subsystem (below) \r\n"},

Epub 2005 Dec 20.\r\n\r\n    MukB is a bacterial SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome)\r\nprotein required for faithful chromosome segregation in Escherichia\r\ncoli. We report here that purified MukB introduces right-handed knots\r\ninto DNA in the presence of type-2 topoisomerase, indicating that the\r\nprotein promotes intramolecular DNA condensation. The pattern of\r\ngenerated knots suggests that MukB, similar to eukaryotic condensins,\r\nstabilizes large right-handed DNA loops. In contrast to eukaryotic\r\ncondensins, however, the net supercoiling stabilized by MukB was\r\nnegative. Furthermore, DNA reshaping by MukB did not require\r\nATP. These data establish that bacterial condensins alter the shape of\r\ndouble-stranded DNA in vitro and lend support to the notions that the\r\nright-handed knotting is the most conserved biochemical property of\r\ncondensins. Finally, we found that MukB can be eluted from a heparin\r\ncolumn in two distinct forms, one of which is inert in DNA binding or\r\nreshaping. Furthermore, we find that the activity of MukB is\r\nreversibly attenuated during chromatographic separation. Thus, MukB\r\nhas a unique set of topological properties, compared with other SMC\r\nproteins, and is likely to exist in two different conformations.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSwiss Prot Description of MukE\r\n\r\nCC   -!- FUNCTION: Involved in chromosome condensation, segregation and\r\nCC       cell cycle progression.

        "description":"Quoted from http://www.jbc.org/content/278/42/41148.full \r\n�The phylogenetic tree of CobN-related proteins has three main branches (data not shown). The first two branches comprise the B12-regulated cobalt chelatases CobN involved in the CBL synthesis and the magnesium chelatases ChlH required for the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis. The third branch, named here BtuS, includes hypothetical proteins of unknown function from diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes. In all cases, the btuS genes are clustered with a new gene, named btuT, which encodes a hypothetical transporter with four predicted TMSs. In addition n, the btuST clusters of P. aeruginosa, R. palustris, and N. europaea (<< SG: and B. fragilis too) are co-localized with hypothetical outer membrane receptor genes encoding proteins homologous to the vitamin B12 receptor BtuB. Moreover, in P. gingivalis and B. fragilis, the btuST genes form a candidate operon with the iron-induced hemoglobin transport genes hmuYR (45). The BtuB-like HmuR receptor was recently found to bind hemoglobin, hemin, various porphyrins, and metalloporphyrins (46). In archaea, the btuST genes are linked to the btuW gene encoding a hypothetical transporter with seven predicted TMSs. These observations allow us to propose that the hypothetical transporter BtuT, chelatase BtuS, and homologs of the BtuB/HmuR receptors (or BtuW in archaea) are involved in the transport and salvage of various metalloporphyrines rather than in the CBL biosynthesis�\r\n",

        "description":"This Subsystem has been encode by Margaret Romine, whose contributions to SEED we gratefully acknowledge.\r\nThis subsystem describes the Fe(III) respiratory system found in Shewanella species.  This system is believed to enable their hosts to utilize both insoluble (Fe, Mn) and soluble metals (V, U) as terminal electron acceptors.  Other bacteria such as Geobacter and Anaeromyxobacteria also possess all or some of these capabilities, but appear to utilize non-homolous proteins to mediate the electron transfer steps.  \r\n\r\nComponents of this electron transfer pathway are distributed across both the inner and outer membrane of this gram negative group of organisms. Electrons are first withdrawn from menaquinone via a specialized membrane-anchored tetraheme cytochrome c, named CymA, that belongs to the NapC family.  This menaquinone oxidase is also required for numerous other anaerobic respiratory pathways in Shewanella.  In S. oneidensis MR-1, CymA is also required for the use of various other electron acceptors including fumarate, nitrate, nitrite, and DSMO (PMID: 9023196, PMID: 12899636).  In Shewanella ANA-3 it also required for respiration of arsenate (PMID: 19760266).  A recent study demonstrated that CymA is sufficient to confer soluble Fe-NTA respiratory capability to E. coli (PMID:18394146).\r\n\r\nThe current hypothesis is that electrons are transferred from CymA to a periplasmic decaheme cytochrome c, named MtrA and then to surface localized multi-heme cytochromes.  There is still some speculation as to whether additional electron carriers mediate the transfer of electrons from CymA to MtrA.  In S. oneidensis MR-1, two surface localized decaheme cytochrome c's, MtrC and OmcA, contribute to Fe(III) reduction.  Both are lipoproteins and require the type II secretion system to mediate their translocation across the outer membrane.\r\n\r\nA beta barrel protein, MtrB, is believed to provide passage for MtrA across the outer membrane whereby it can make contact with and transfer electrons to surface bound c-type cytochromes, MtrC and OmcA (PMID: 20002197).\r\n\r\nComparative analysis of 21 sequenced Shewanella reveals that CymA, MtrA, MtrB, and MtrC are conserved in all of the strains that reduce Fe(III) (all but S. denitrificans)(PMID: 18604222).  A second complex (MtrDEF) analogous to MtrCAB is found in some of the strains.  Varying numbers of additional c-type cytochromes, all lipoproteins predicted to localize to the cell surface and some predicted to bind 11 hemes (UndA, UndB), are encoded next to MtrCAB.  The substrate selectivity of these putative surface localized proteins is currently unknown.  Expression of MtrDEF has only been observed in aggregated cells (PMID: 18412550).   \r\n\r\n",

        "description":"Tocochromanols are a group of amphipathic, lipid-soluble organic molecules composed of a polar moiety derived from tyrosine and a hydrophobic polyprenyl side chain originating from the isoprenoid pathway. Tocochromanols with a phytyl-derived side chain are termed tocopherols whereas those with a geranylgeranyl-derived side chain are termed tocotrienols. The four different forms of tocopherols and tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) differ by the degree of methylation of the chromanol ring. \r\n\r\nVitamin E is a generic term describing this group of eight lipophilic compounds in the tocopherol and tocotrienol families.  They are synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic organisms and are essential dietary components for humans and other mammals. All tocochromanols are potent lipid-soluble antioxidants, which protects polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes against degradation by reactive oxygen species such as ozone, singlet oxygen, peroxides and hyperoxides (PMID:20036132; 12949564)\r\n\r\nIn plants, biosynthesis of tocopherols and tocotrienols is localized to the plastids of seeds and the chloroplasts of leaves.  In seeds of most monocot plants (including cereals such as rice and wheat) the primary form of vitamin E is tocotrienols.  Homogentisate geranylgeranyl-transferase (HGGT) specific for tocotrienol synthesis was characterized from barley, rice and wheat (PMID:12897790, 12949564)\r\n \r\nGenes of all the pathway enzymes have been cloned from Arabidopsis and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Tocopherols are synthesized by a pathway that is conserved between cyanobacteria and plants as follows (shown on the Diagram and Illustration) -\r\n  The conversion of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (I) to homogentisic acid (II) by HPP dioxygenase (HPPD) yields the aromatic head group for both tocopherol and plastoquinone biosynthesis in plants. . The committed step in tocopherol synthesis is the condensation of the homogentisic acid and phytyldiphosphate by homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT) to produce the first tocopherol intermediate, 2-methyl-6-phytylbenzoquinone (IV).\r\nBiochemical analyses have shown that the steps leading from MPBQ to {alpha}-tocopherol are as follows: \r\n-ring methylation of MPBQ by 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone/2-methyl-6-solanyl-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase (MPBQ/MSBQ MT) to yield 2,3-dimethyl-5-phytylbenzoquinone (DMPBQ);\r\n- ring cyclization of DMPBQ by tocopherol cyclase (TC) to yield {gamma}-tocopherol; \r\n- a second ring methylation by {gamma}-tocopherol methyltransferase to yield {alpha}-tocopherol\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nThis subsystem incorporates the following AraCyc pathway:\r\nvitamin E biosynthesis: <a href=\"http://pmn.plantcyc.org/PLANT/new-image?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-1422&detail-level=2&ENZORG=ORG-5993\">PWY-1422</a>\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "notes":["HPPD  - Plant 4- hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) has been genetically and biochemically demonstrated involved in tocopherol and plastoquinone biosynthesis. In mammals and non-photosynthetic bacteria, however, HPPD is involved in tyrosine degradation. Plant HPPD may also be involved in tyrosine degradation. HPPD has been purified from Arabidopsis and carrot, and it appears as a homodimer in both species. However, maize HPPD was reported a monomer.\r\n HPT - The gene encoding HPT, HPT1, has been cloned from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Arabidopsis.\r\nIn photosynthetic organisms, condensation of HGA with either a 20- or 45-carbon prenyl-DP is the branch point in tocopherol and plastoquinone synthesis, respectively. It was suggested that separate prenylation enzymes might be involved. Indeed, At3g11950 was later shown to encode homogentisate solanesyltransferases involved in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis (PMID:16989822, 17569077) \r\n\r\nMPBM - 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone/2-methyl-6-solanyl-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase (MPBM/MSBM), which catalyzes a key methylation step in both tocopherol and plastoquinone (PQ) synthesis. \r\n It was isolated and characterized the VTE3 (vitamin E defective) locus, which encodes MPBM/MSBM in Arabidopsis. \r\n In vitro enzyme assays confirmed that VTE3 is the plant functional equivalent of the previously characterized MPBM/MSBM (Sll0418) from Synechocystis sp PCC6803, although the two proteins are highly divergent in primary sequence. \r\n  Sll0418 orthologs are present in all fully sequenced cyanobacterial genomes, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana but absent from vascular and nonvascular plant databases. \r\n  VTE3 orthologs are present in all vascular and nonvascular plant databases and in C. reinhardtii but absent from cyanobacterial genomes. A comparison of protein amino acid sequences confirmed that Arabidopsis VTE3 is not an ortholog of the Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 MPBQ/MSBQ MT, because the two proteins share only 18% identity in their primary amino acid sequences. However, biochemical and genetic analyses showed that Arabidopsis VTE3 represents the functional equivalent of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 MPBQ/MSBQ MT. This finding is quite interesting from an evolutionary perspective, because all other enzymes of the tocopherol pathway are highly conserved between higher plants and cyanobacteria.\r\n  The finding indicates that, unlike Arabidopsis, functional redundancy exists for MPBQ/MSBQ MT in Synechocystis sp PCC6803 and that this step in tocopherol and PQ synthesis has diverged significantly in cyanobacteria and plants. we have isolated and characterized an Arabidopsis MPBQ/MSBQ MT that is the nonorthologous functional equivalent of its cyanobacterial counterpart. The Arabidopsis VTE3 gene encodes a protein and activity in tocopherol and PQ biosynthesis that are highly conserved in photosynthetic eukaryotes. An intriguing question remains regarding when and how this plant enzyme evolved from archea, the third domain of life, whereas all other steps of the plant tocopherol biosynthetic pathway appear to have originated from an endosymbiotic event with a cyanobacterium.\r\n\r\ngTPM - The last enzyme of the pathway, {gamma}-tocopherol methyltransferase ({gamma}-TMT), catalyzes methylation of {gamma}- and {delta}-tocopherol to {alpha}- and {beta}-tocopherol, respectively. \r\n\r\n============== References =============================\r\n\r\n1.

Eukaryotic COX is a complex enzyme, which consists of 11�13 subunits, prokaryotic enzyme usually have a less complex organization.  Biogenesis of this complex requires sophisticated mechanisms of recruitment and stabilization of (both nuclearly and mitochondrially encoded) protein subunits; delivery, formation and insertion of the cofactors and metal ions.   Significant progress in understanding of COX biogenesis has been made recently � especially in yeast.  \r\n\r\nThis SS encodes data obtained largely in S. cerevisia.  Also, an attempt was made to project it into other organisms including prokaryotes.  Please, note a series of great publications from Banci, Bertini and coworkers describing the use of genomic-context analysis (conserved neighborhood, gene fusions, phylogenetic occurrence) in combination with homology-based methods (genome search, structure modeling, correlated mutation analysis) for projection of these eukaryotic data into prokaryotic systems.\r\n\r\nVariant codes\r\n\r\n1:  a complete set of known COX biogenesis factors (as described for S. cerevisiae as of Nov 2005) is present in an organism \r\n2:  eukaryotic organisms containing homologs of yeast COX biogenesis factors \r\n3:  prokaryotic organisms where at least a few proteins related to yeast COX biogenesis factors can   be asserted.

It is present on most C. jejuni isolates (PMID: 24498018)\n\nRecently, the three steps of a rather unusual biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of the MeOPN modification were elucidated (PMID: 29023101; PMID: 28650156). It was shown that the enzyme Cj1418 catalyzes the phosphorylation of the amide nitrogen of l-glutamine to form l-glutamine phosphate (PMID: 28650156).  The enzyme Cj1416 catalyzes the displacement of pyrophosphate from MgCTP by l-glutamine phosphate to form CDP-l-glutamine. The enzyme Cj1417 subsequently catalyzes the hydrolysis of CDP-l-glutamine to generate cytidine diphosphoramidate and l-glutamate.  It is proposed that the enzyme Cj1416 be named CTP:phosphoglutamine cytidylyltransferase and that the enzyme Cj1417 be named &#947;-glutamyl-CDP-amidate hydrolase (PMID: 29023101).

        "description":"RuvABC is well-studied.  The description from Wikipedia is as follows:\n\nRuvABC is a complex of three proteins that mediate branch migration and resolve the Holliday junction created during recombination repair.\n\nRuvA and RuvB bind to the four strand DNA structure formed in the Holliday junction intermediate, and migrate the strands through each other, using a putative spooling mechanism. The binding of the RuvC protein to the RuvAB complex is thought to cleave the DNA strands, thereby resolving the Holliday junction.\n\nThe structure of the complex has been variously elucidated through X-ray crystallography and EM data, and suggest that the complex consists of either one or two RuvA tetramers, with charge lined grooves through which the incoming DNA is channelled. The structure also showed the presence of so-called 'acidic pins' in the centre of the tetramer, which serve to separate the DNA duplexes.\n\nThe RuvB proteins are thought to form hexameric rings on the exit points of the newly formed DNA duplexes, and it is proposed that they 'spool' the emerging DNA through the RuvA tetramer.\n\nRuvC is the resolvase, which cleaves the Holliday junction. It is thought to bind either on the open, DNA exposed face of a single RuvA tetramer, or to replace one of the two tetramers. Binding is proposed to be mediated by an unstructured loop on RuvC, which becomes structured on binding RuvA. RuvC can be bound to the complex in either orientation, therefore resolving Holliday junctions in either a horizontal or vertical manner.\n======================\n\nThis subsystem is more about the other gene that often clusters with ruvABC.  The gene is often annotated as \"Concerved hypothetical protein yebC\".  However, this name for the gene actually is used to describe a number of distinct functions (in my opinion), so I have elected to use instead\n\n       FIG000859: hypothetical protein\n\nThis is simply a name for a functional role that I do not yet understand. However, I am deeply\nconvinced that there is some relationship between the role of this gene and RuvABC.  Hence, I\nthink that the gene is probably related to recombination.\n\n",

Sharples, Stuart M. Ingleston, and Robert G. Lloyd\n\nJournal of Bacteriology, September 1999, p. 5543-5550, Vol. 181, No. 18\n\n CONSERVATION OF RUVABC IN BACTERIA\n\n\"Genes encoding homologs of RuvA and RuvB are widespread in bacteria, whereas homologs of RuvC are less common (Fig. 3). The ruvA and ruvB genes are often found together in an operon, sometimes including ruvC upstream, although there are cases, such as in Synechocystis, where the three ruv genes are scattered around the genome in separate operons. RuvC is absent from the completed genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, and Borrelia burgdorferi and has yet to be found in Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium spp. (Fig. 3). A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences shows that Mycoplasma, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Bacillus spp. define a branch of the tree that seems to lack RuvC (Fig. 4). The absence of RuvC from B. burgdorferi is puzzling, especially as it is present in the related spirochete Treponema pallidum. As some of these genomes contain the Holliday junction resolvase RusA (Fig. 3), they could be using this enzyme instead. However, several organisms have neither RuvC nor RusA, suggesting the existence of an alternative Holliday junction resolvase whose nature has yet to be described. It would seem incongruous to have the enzymes to move Holliday junctions (RuvAB) but lack the means to resolve them.\"\n=============================\n\nThe conjecture we mentioned was arrived at earlier in the following paper:\n\n\nNucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32(8): 2353�2361.\nPublished online 2004 April 30. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkh555.\n\t\n\nIdentification and functional analysis of �hypothetical� genes expressed in Haemophilus influenzae\nEugene Kolker, Kira S. Makarova, Svetlana Shabalina,1 Alex F. Picone, Samuel Purvine, Ted Holzman, Tim Cherny, David Armbruster,2 Robert S. Munson, Jr, Grigory Kolesov, Dmitrij Frishman, and Michael Y. Galperin1\n\n\n\"Likewise, the structures of HI0315 (YebC) homologs from Aquifex aeolicus (43) and E.coli failed to suggest the function for this protein, encoded in every bacterium except Buchnera. Nevertheless, the conserved association of the yebC gene with ruvABC genes, encoding three subunits of the Holliday junction resolvasome, coupled with the universal presence of this gene in all bacteria (except Buchnera) leave little doubt that HI0315 protein is somehow involved in the same process. Since the yebC gene appears to be non-essential in H.influenzae (Table 1S), it could encode an auxiliary component of the resolvasome that plays a role in DNA replication or, less likely, DNA transcription.\"\n\n\n"],

Genes encoding a novel 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase were identified in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Together, these two enzymes convert 2-oxoglutarate to succinate and thus functionally replace 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase. These genes are present in all cyanobacterial genomes except those of Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus species. Closely related genes occur in the genomes of some methanogens and other anaerobic bacteria, which are also thought to have incomplete TCA cycles.\n"],

In this study, we found that the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, not only biosynthesizes lysine through LysW-mediated protection of AAA but also uses LysW to protect the amino group of glutamate in arginine biosynthesis. In this archaeon, after LysW modification, AAA and glutamate are converted to lysine and ornithine, respectively, by a single set of enzymes with dual functions. The crystal structure of ArgX, the enzyme responsible for modification and protection of the amino moiety of glutamate with LysW, was determined in complex with LysW. Structural comparison and enzymatic characterization using Sulfolobus LysX, Sulfolobus ArgX and Thermus LysX identify the amino acid motif responsible for substrate discrimination between AAA and glutamate. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that gene duplication events at different stages of evolution led to ArgX and LysX.\n",

With the complete restriction map of E. coli, the mutation was rapidly mapped to 50.0 min, within the purF operon. Sequence analysis showed that the insertion occurred in a gene with no previously known function which is located directly upstream of purF. We designated this gene cvpA for colicin V production. The mutant requires adenine for growth, probably because of a polar effect on purF expression. However, an adenine auxotroph showed no defect in colicin V production, suggesting that the cvpA mutation is responsible for the effect on colicin V production. Two possible models of cvpA1 allele function are discussed.\n"],

PMID: 25986884\r\nAbstract\r\nThe exclusive mycobacterial cell wall lipids such as trehalose monomycolate and dimycolate (TMM, TDM), phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), sulpholipid-1 (SL-1), diacyl trehalose (DAT), and pentacyl trehalose (PAT), among others, are known to play an important role in pathogenesis; thus, proteins responsible for their transport are potential virulence factors. MmpL and MmpS proteins mediate transport of important cell wall lipids across the mycobacterial membrane. In Mtb, MmpL3, MmpL7 and MmpL8 transport TMM, PDIM and SL-1 respectively. The translocation of DAT and biosynthesis of PAT is likely due to MmpL10. MmpL and MmpS proteins are involved in other processes such as drug efflux (MmpL5 and MmpL7), siderophore export (MmpL4/MmpS4 and MmpL5/MmpS5), and heme uptake (MmpL3 and MmpL11). Altogether, these proteins can be regarded as new potential targets for antituberculosis drug development. \r\n\r\nMmpL5 and MmpS5 proteins contribute to azoles resistance in Mycobacteria (PMID: 18851927). \r\nAnalysis of several spontaneous azoles resistant mutants from M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG demonstrated both, an increased econazole efflux and increased transcription of mmpS5-mmpL5 genes.  The  up-regulation of mmpS5-mmpL5 genes was furthee linked to mutations either in the Rv0678 gene, hypothesized to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of this efflux system (PMID: 18851927)\r\n",

        "notes":["Ribonucleotide reductases.\r\nRibonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyse the reduction of ribonucleotides to their corresponding 2`-deoxyribonucleotides and therefore play an essential role for DNA synthesis [1]. There are three classes of RNR, with different primary structures, subunits, cofactor requirements and regulation but all of them have allosteric regulation [2]. \r\n\r\nClass I RNRs are aerobic enzymes composed of two homodimeric proteins, which are widely distributed both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Class I is divided into two distantly related subclasses, NrdAB (Ia) and NrdEF (Ib), which are similar on the sequence level but form distinct branches on the phylogenetic trees. \r\n\r\nSingle-subunit class II RNRs, named NrdJ, require coenzyme-B12, or S-adenosylcobalamine, as a radical generator and do not depend on oxygen. Occurring in deeply rooted eubacteria, archaea and bacteriophages, NrdJ proteins are distantly related to NrdA and NrdE [3]. \r\n\r\nMembers of class III RNRs are expressed in strict anaerobes and in certain facultative anaerobes during growth under anaerobic conditions (In E.coli nrdDG is regulated by a regulator of anaerobiosis, FNR). Large catalytic subunit of class III RNR, encoded by nrdD gene, is not related to Class I and Class II RNRs. NrdD is in its active form a homodimer. The smaller subunit NrdG is an iron sulfur protein, also known as NrdD-activating protein, that catalizes the one-electron transfer from reduced flavodoxin to S-adenosylmethionine to generate a stable glycine radical near the carboxy-terminal portion of the NrdD subunit.\r\n\r\nThe Escherichia coli genome contains three RNRs operons, nrdAB, nrdHIEF and nrdDG.\r\n\r\nNrdR is a novel transcriptional regulator of all RNRs, which was predicted using comparative genomics analysis of regulation of ribonucleotide reductase genes in bacterial genomes. A highly conserved palindromic signal with consensus acaCwAtATaTwGtg, named NrdR-box, was identified upstream of most operons encoding ribonuleotide reductases of three different classes. By correlating the occurrence of NrdR-boxes with phylogenetic distribution of ortholog families we were able to identify a transcriptional regulator containing Zn-ribbon and ATP-cone motifs (COG1327) for the predicted ribonucleotide reductase regulon [5]. \r\n\r\nReferences.\r\n1.\tReichard P.

        "description":"Siderophore enterobactin is a triscatechol derivative of a cyclic triserine lactone that enables bacteria to recover iron from their environment. Believed earlier to be unique to Gram-negative bacteria, enterobactin has been isolated recently from two Gram-positive Streptomyces species.  It is a cyclic compound of three 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine units joined in a cyclic structure by lactone linkages (see molecular diagram on slide two).  Enterobactin is synthesized under low iron concentration conditions and excreted into the environment where it binds Fe(III) with high affinity and specificity. The ferrisiderophore complexes are taken up into the cell by specific ATP-binding cassette transporter complex.  \r\n\r\nFrom (Chen et al., 2009): Enterobactin biosynthesis proceeds via an upper chemical pathway that forms 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (2,3-DHB) from chorismate and a lower, iterative pathway that assembles enterobactin from L-serine and 2,3-DHB.  The lower pathway (see Tab �Illustrations�) employs the two nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) EntB and EntF. The phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) �EntD� catalyzes the transfer of pantetheinephosphate from CoA to the Ser residue of the 2,3-DHB carrier domain of EntB and of the peptidyl carrier domain of EntF to generate holo-EntB and holo-EntF, respectively.  EntE catalyzes the adenylation of 2,3-DHB and the subsequent aroyl transfer to the pantetheine thiol of holo-EntB.  The adenylation domain of holo-EntF catalyzes the adenylation of L-Ser and subsequent transfer of an acyl group to the pantetheine thiol carrier domain of holo-EntF.  The EntF condensation domain then catalyzes the transfer of the 2,3-DHB unit to the amine group  of the EntF-tethered L-Ser.  The 2,3-DHB-Ser unit is then transferred to the active site Ser of the EntF cyclizing thioesterase domain, thereby freeing the pantetheine thiol for acquisition of a second 2,3-DHB-Ser-DHB unit.  It in turn is transferred to the Ser moiety side chain of 2,3-DHB-Ser tethered to the TE domain.  Following the addition of a third 2,3-DHB-Ser unit, the chain is cyclized by the thioesterase domain to form enterobactin.  \r\n\r\nThe genes encoding the enterobactin biosynthetic enzymes are clustered within cotranscriptional units, one of which includes EntC and EntA of the upper pathway and EntE, EntB, and EntH (also known as ybdB) of the lower pathway.\r\n",

        "description":"The observation that Enterococcus faecalis strains containing certain plasmids give rise to bacterial aggregates  when mixed with plasmid-free cells led to the discovery  of bacterial sex pheromones (Dunny et al., 1978). These small linear peptide molecules act as signals that facilitate the conjugative transfer of a  specific category of plasmids referred to as pheromone-  responsive plasmids.  Pheromones secreted by plasmid-free cells can induce a process in which plasmid-containing cells become activated for both adherence to potential recipients (those that produced and secreted the pheromone) and plasmid transfer.  Once a recipient cell acquires a given plasmid, the  corresponding pheromone is no longer detected in the  culture supernatant of the transconjugant because of �shutdown� or �masking� of the endogenous peptide (although pheromones specific for unrelated plasmids continue to be secreted). The newly resident plasmid encodes  and directs the production of a small peptide that is somewhat similar to its cognate pheromone but acts as a competitive inhibitor. Uptake of pheromones is mediated by Pheromone binding protein TraC/PrgZ, which recruits chromosomal oligopeptide Opp transport system (Leonard, et al., 1996).  \n\nThe known enterococcal sex pheromones (cAD1, cPD1, cCF10, cAM373, and cOB1) and related inhibitors are all relatively hydrophobic, linear octa- or heptapeptides that are active at nanomolar concentrations (reviewed in Clewell, 1993; 1999; Wirth, 1994; Dunny and Leonard,  1997). For example, pheromone cAD1 is an octapeptide with the sequence LFSLVLAG. \n\nWith the recent availability of enterococcal genome sequence data, it was noted that a pheromone peptide is encoded as a part of the signal sequences of precursors of certain lipoproteins (An & Clewell. 2002.). In most cases, the signal sequences correspond to 21- or 22-amino-acid segments, with the last 7 or 8 residues representing the specific pheromone. Typical lipoprotein signal peptidase target sites are appropriately located such that cleavage results in separation of the signal sequence, which in turn needs only to be processed at a second location seven or eight residues from the other processing site to generate a mature pheromone peptide.  The former process is believed to be catalyzed by Signal peptidase II, the later � by metalloprotease Eep (An & Clewell, 2002).  It is not known if there is a functional relationship between the activity of the putative lipoproteins and the pheromone component of their precursor structures or whether the lipoprotein connection is simply fortuitous.\n\nPheromone-responding plasmids are highly transmissible between strains of E. faecalis and are believed to contribute to the horizontal dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (Clewell, 1990) and virulence factors such as cytolysin (Gilmore etal., 1994) and adhesins (Hirt et al., 2000; Rozdzinski et al., 2001). Biosynthesis of plasmid-encoded hemolysin and aggregation substance, induced by pheromones have been shown to contribute to virulence (e.g., Sussmuth et al., 2000). Aggregation substance Asa1/PrgB has two RGD motifs that may be responsible for the ability of plasmid-carrying cells to attach to porcine renal kidney epithelial cells (Kreft et al., 1992).\n\nSurprisingly, the E. faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmid  pAM373 (De Boever et al., 2000), has the unusual ability  to respond not only to a specific E. faecalis peptide,  cAM373, but also to similar peptides secreted by the non-enterococcal species:  Streptococcus  gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus (Clewell et al.,  1985).  The staphylococcal peptide has been identified � AIFILAA (Nakayama et al., 1996) and differs from the enterococcal cAM373 peptide by only one amino acid � an alanine rather than a serine at the carboxyl-terminus.  Furthermore, orthologs of the Putative pheromone cAM373 precursor lipoprotein CamS are evident in the genomes of many Bacilli, Listeria, Thermoanaerobacter, Lactobacilli, etc. (Flannagan & Clewell, 2002).  Although it is not known whether the peptides produced  by different genera actually represent sex pheromones  significant to these organisms, it is conceivable that they  could play a role in the acquisition of pAM373 and related  plasmids from enterococci, contributing to cross-species spread of antibiotic-resistance factors. \n"},

They can be components of two different complexes with prevailing succinate: quinone oxidoreductase or quinol:fumarate oxidoreductase activities (as in case of E.coli). Please, look at 'Succinate dehydrogenase' subsystem to obtain additional information.\r\nDihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4) (lpdA) of pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes are homologous. Presence of lpdA ,when E1 and E2 components of 2-oxoglutarate complex are absent is due to this homology, lpdA in this case is actually a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.\r\nAconitase X is encoded in the genomes of many archaea and some proteobacteria. Among archaea, the pattern of aconitase X occurrence complements that of aconitase A such that together the two enzymes account for aconitase activity in all archaea.Koonin et al,FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2003 Oct 10;227(1):17-23.(??)\r\n\r\nPlease, use Seed's feature 'color rows by each organism's attribute (select 'Oxygen') to see, that anaerobic bacteria usually have only few functions from this subsystem set.\r\n  \r\nAbsence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex does not correlate with respiration specificity of an organism. But, it is usually compensated by presence of 4-subunit 2-oxoglutarate synthase complex. The latter function is placed in the 'associated functions' subset. (1 or 2 subunits shown for some organisms in this sub-spreadsheet likely belong to other homologous complexes (as pyruvate synthase), they do not correlate with the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex ). In case of some bacteria, were presence of this complex have been postulated (as Chlorobium),absence of g and d subunits is problematic.\r\nSuccinyl-CoA ligase is mnissinbg from some organisms (some Cyanobacteria (Prochlorococci, Synechococci).Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP] (EC 1.1.1.42) is missing from Corynebacteria. Isocitrate dehydrogenas, aconitase and citrate synthase are missing from Chlamydophilae.  Functional explanations are possible. Or: there are missing genes in some of those cases?\r\n\r\n3.1.2.3 can substitute the absence of 6.2.1.4 and 6.2.1.5 (SucD, SucC) but it seems to be missing (no sequence)\r\n3.1.2.16-no sequences (?)\r\n6.2.1.18-component of 4.1.3.8-no sequence.\r\n\r\nFumarase: we did not include anaerobic fumarase in the main spreadsheet.

Proteasomes unfold, and digest protein substrates. In eukayotes individual subcomplexes of the complete 26S proteasome are involved in these different tasks: The ATP-dependent 19S caps are believed to unfold substrates and feed them to the actual protease, the 20S proteasome. This core particle appears to be more ancient than the eukayotic ubiquitin marking system. Both prokaryotic and archaebacterial ancestors have been identified. Crystal structures are available for the E. coli proteasome homologue and the T. acidophilum and S. cerevisiae 20S proteasomes. All three complexes are cylindrical particles that have their active sites on the inner walls of a large central cavity. They share the fold and a novel catalytic mechanism with an N-terminal nucleophilic threonine, which places them in the family of Ntn (N terminal nucleophile) hydrolases. The bacterial (minimal) proteasome is a homododecamer made from two hexameric rings (HslV & HslU) stacked head to head. Its heptameric version is the catalytic core of archaebacterial proteasomes, where it is sandwiched between two inactive antichambers that are made up from a different subunit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBochtler M, Ditzel L, Groll M, Hartmann C, Huber R.

        "description":"Originally the tldE (pmbA) and tldD E.coli mutants were isolated as being resistant to CcdB, a natural poison of gyrase encoded by the CcdA/CcdB poison-antidote system of plasmid F (Murayama, et al., 1996).  In addition, the TldE/PmbA protein was implicated in proteolytic maturation of Microcin B17 - a peptide antibiotic produced by Escherichia coli strains carrying the pMccB17 plasmid (Rodriguez-Sainz et al., 1990).   The Microcin B17 action mechanism is believed to be similar to that of synthetic quinolones and the bacterial poison CcdB.  This led to the idea that TldD and TldE could regulate gyrase function. \r\n\r\nHowever, (Allali et al., 2002) have demonstrated that TldD and TldE proteins form a proteolytically active complex, which acts on antidote CcdA and on pro-MccB17.  They have also hypothesized that CcdA and pro-MccB17 were not the only (not the main?) substrates for TldD/TldE protease.  This idea was based in part on the phylogenic distribution of the TldD and TldE proteins, which have homologs in genomes of many eubacteria and archaebacteria (including those that do not encode a CcdA/CcdB system or biosynthesis of Microcin B17), suggesting a broader physiological role. \r\n\r\nNo sequence homology is detectable between pro-MccB17 and CcdA, but their common feature could be a lack of structure. Therefore, (Allali et al., 2002) suggested that TldD and TldE could participate directly or indirectly in biodegradation of unstructured polypeptides.

        "description":"Sphingolipids are a class of lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid bases, a set of aliphatic amino alcohols that includes sphingosine. A sphingolipid with an R group consisting of a hydrogen atom only is a ceramide. Other common R groups include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers.  They were first discovered in mammalian brain extracts.\n\nQuoted from (Sohlenkamp & Geiger, 2015): \"Sphingolipids (SLs) are ubiquitous components of the eukaryotic cytoplasmic membrane where they have important functions in signal transduction processes and in the formation of lipid rafts. In contrast, SLs occur only in a few bacteria, mainly belonging to the CFB group and the Sphingomonadales of the Alphaproteobacteria, but they are also present in a few Deltaproteobacteria such as Bdellovibrio, Cystobacter fuscus, My. stipitatus, S. cellulosum and M. xanthus (Keck et al. 2011; Lorenzen et al. 2014). Sequence analysis based on the presence of genes encoding for putative serine palmitoyltransferases (SPTs) indicates that SLs might be present in a few Alphaproteobacteria outside the Sphingomonadales and even in a few Beta- and Gamma- Proteobacteria. \n    A variety of SL headgroups has been described in bacteria, such as ceramides, ceramide phosphoethanolamines, glucosyl sphingenine and ceramide phosphoinositols (Eckau, Dill and Budzikiewicz 1984; Stein and Budzikiewicz 1988; Keck et al. 2011; Lorenzen et al. 2014). In the Sphingomonadales, SLs are mainly decorated with sugar residues. In Bacteroides species, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol have been described. \n    The eukaryotic genes involved in SL biosynthesis have identified but little is known about SL synthesis in bacteria (Dickson 2010; Geiger et al. 2010; Pata et al. 2010). Only the first step, catalyzed by SPT, is characterized in detail (Lowther et al. 2011, 2012). Even the crystal structures of the SPTs from Sphingomonas paucimobilis, S. wittichii and Sphingobacterium multivorum have been determined (Yard et al. 2007; Ikushiro et al. 2009; Raman et al. 2010). In eukaryotes, acyl-CoA and serine are the substrates for this enzyme, whereas for the enzyme from S. wittichii acyl-ACP has been suggested as acyl donor, because the gene-encoding SPT forms an operon with a gene encoding a putative ACP (Geiger et al. 2010; Raman et al. 2010). \n   SLs are often 2-hydroxylated and the alpha-hydroxylase catalyzing this reaction has been identified and characterized from different bacteria (Matsunaga et al. 1997; Ring et al. 2009; Fujishiro et al. 2011). Not much is known about the functions of bacterial SLs. It has been described that some Gram-negative bacteria, such as Sp. capsulata, Sp. adhaerens and S. cellulosum, lack LPS in their outer membrane and instead have glycosphingolipids as functional replacements (Kawahara et al. 2000, 2001; Keck et al. 2011)\"\n\n\nReferences\n\nSohlenkamp C, Geiger O. 2015.

PMID:21383189\r\nAbstract\r\nMycobacterium tuberculosis must import iron from its host for survival, and its siderophore-dependent iron acquisition pathways are well established. Here we demonstrate a newly characterized pathway, whereby M. tuberculosis can use free heme and heme from hemoglobin as an iron source. Significantly, we identified the genomic region, Rv0202c-Rv0207c, responsible for the passage of heme iron across the mycobacterial membrane. Key players of this heme uptake system were characterized including a secreted protein and two transmembrane proteins, all three specific to mycobacteria. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the key heme carrier protein Rv0203 was found to have a unique fold. The discovery of a unique mycobacterial heme acquisition pathway opens new avenues of exploration into mycobacterial therapeutics.\r\n",

        "description":"The LytR-CpsA-Psr family members are putative transmembrane proteins carrying a so-called LytR-CpsA-Psr domain, which is predicted to be extracellular.  LytR was first described in Bacillus subtilis, where it acts as an attenuator of the expression of both itself and the divergently transcribed lytABC operon, which encodes a putative lipoprotein (LytA), an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (LytC) and its modifier LytB (Lazarevic et al., 1992).  CpsA is suggested to play a role in transcription activation of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon of Streptococcus agalactiae (Cieslewicz et al., 2001).  Psr was initially proposed to be a repressor of penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) synthesis in Enterococcus hirae (Massiddet al., 1996; however, see also (Sapunaric et al. 2003)).  In contrast, the LytR homolog BrpA affects autolytic activity of Streptococcus mutans (Chatfield et al., 2005) and positively influences biofilm formation ability as well as acidic and oxidative stress tolerance (Wen et al., 2006).  Furthermore, BrpA inactivation alters phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the outcome of bacteremia in a rat model.\r\n\r\nAll Gram-positive organisms possess LytR-CpsA-Psr proteins, except for the Mollicutes that seem to have lost this protein family in the course of diversification.  In contrast, the LytR-CpsA-Psr domain was only observed in a minority of the Gram-negatives.  Notably, most of the latter posses cell walls that show features of a typical Gram-positive cell wall, such as a thick, multilayered peptidoglycan, a high cross-linking extent, or polysaccharides cross-linked to the peptidoglycan (e.g. various Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexus aurantiacus, Deinococcus radiodurans, etc) (Hubscher et al., 2008)\r\n\r\nMembers of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family of cell envelope-associated attenuators are relevant for such virulence-associated functions as &#946;-lactam resistance, biofilm formation, and stress tolerance. Although their precise function is still unknown, they are believed to play a role in ensuring cell envelope integrity (Hubscher et al., 2008)\r\n",

        "description":"Molybdenum is an essential trace element in the form of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) which is associated with the metabolism of nitrogen, carbon and sulfur by redox active enzymes. Moco contains a tricyclic pyranopterin, termed molybdopterin (MPT). MoeA, together with MoaB, is responsible for the metal incorporation into MPT, the third step in Moco biosynthesis. MPT carries the cis-dithiolene group responsible for molybdenum ligation. This dithiolene group is generated by MPT synthase in the second major step in Moco biosynthesis. MPT synthase is a heterotetramer consisting of two large (MoaE) and two small (MoaD) subunits. The small subunit 2xMoaD) is inserted into the lare subunit (2xMoaE) to form the active site. The small subunit, which is structurally similar to ubiquitin, contains a C-terminal thiocarboxylated glycine residue that serves as a sulfur donor for the synthesis of the MPT dithiolene group. MoaC, a small hexameric protein, converts, together with MoaA, a guanosine derivative to the precursor Z by inserting the carbon-8 of the purine between the 2' and 3' ribose carbon atoms, which is the first of three phases of Moco biosynthesis. (bacterial MoaA NOT archaeal MoaA) MoaB shows high similarity to MogA, but little is known about its physiological role.  MoeB, like ThiF, begins with a nucleophilic attack of the C-terminal carboxylate of MoaD and ThiS, respectively, on the alpha-phosphate of an ATP molecule bound at the active site of the activating enzymes, leading to the formation of a high-energy acyladenylate intermediate and subsequently to the formation of a thiocarboxylate at the C termini of MoaD and ThiS. MPT can be further modified by attachment of a GMP group to the terminal phosphate of MPT to form molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD). This GMP attachment step is catalyzed by MobA, by linking a guanosine 5'-phosphate to MPT forming molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide. This reaction requires GTP, MgCl2, and the MPT form of the cofactor. It is a reaction unique to prokaryotes?\r\n",

A three-enzyme system (MoeB, MoaD, and MoaE) for the sulfur transfer to precursor Z in molybdopterin biosynthesis has been reconstituted (39). ThiF and MoeB (GenBankTM accession number 127233) show high sequence similarity, and both MoaD (GenBankTM accession number 2507065) and ThiS contain the carboxyl-terminal GG residues and bind sulfur as a thiocarboxylate \r\nThe molybdenum cofactor is part of the active site of all eukaryotic molybdenum (Mo)- containing enzymes. Mo is covalently bound to two sulfur atoms of a unique tricyclic pterin moiety known as molybdopterin. Molybdopterin is synthesized from GTP by an ancient and conserved biosynthetic pathway that can be divided into four steps involving the biosynthetic intermediates cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, molybdopterin, and adenylated molybdopterin. In a fifth step, sulfuration or bond formation between Mo and a protein cysteine result in two different catalytic Mo centers.\r\nSchwarz, G. and Mendel, R. R.

Two enzymatic reactions convert this triphosphate to the cyclic phosphate of pyranopterin. One of these enzymes utilizes radical SAMs, often associated with C-X bond forming reactions. This intermediate pyranopterin is then converted to the molybdopterin via the action of three further enzymes. In this conversion the enedithiolate is formed, although the substituents on sulfur remain unknown. Sulfur is conveyed from cysteinyl persulfide in a manner reminiscent of the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins. The monophosphate is adenylated (coupled to ADP) in a step that activates the cofactor toward binding Mo or W.

Most bacterial species have a single copy of the genes encoding SecA and SecY, which are essential for viability. However, Streptococcus gordonii strain M99 encodes SecA and SecY homologues that are not required for viability or for the translocation of most exported proteins. The genes (secA2 and secY2) reside in a region of the chromosome required for the export of GspB, a 286 kDa cell wall-anchored protein. Loss of GspB surface expression is associated with a significant reduction in the binding of M99 to human platelets, suggesting that it may be an adhesin. Genetic analyses indicate that M99 has a second, canonical SecA homologue that is essential for viability. At least two other Gram-positive species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, encode two sets of SecA and SecY homologues. One set is more similar to SecA and SecY of Escherichia coli, whereas the other set is more similar to SecA2 and SecY2 of strain M99. The conserved organization of genes in the secY2-secA2 loci suggests that, in each of these Gram-positive species, SecA2 and SecY2 may constitute a specialized system for the transport of a very large serine-rich repeat protein.\r\n\r\n    PMID: 12010500 \r\n"],

        "notes":["This subsystem was originally encoded by master:JasonS_UCSD. \r\n\r\n=========Overview:=======================\r\n\r\nIn several organisms, Alanine dehydrogenase bears significant similarity to NAD(P) transhydrogenase alpha subunit (EC 1.6.1.2)--on the order of 10^-25 which preforms a similar function but no annotation changes were made considering the significant support by other sources of the NAD(P) transhydrogenase alpha subunit (EC 1.6.1.2) annotation.\r\n\r\nFunctional role of EC 4.3.1.17 SerD was screened for similarity and found to be annotated equally as serine deaminase as well as serine dehydratase for which every match had >99% similarity and all EC numbers were the same.  Since this annotation only occured in this subsystem, the functional roles were changed to be consistant as L-Serine dehydratase (EC 4.3.1.17) which is preferentially used over serine deaminase (EC 4.3.1.17) in other databases such as NCBI and Uniprot.\r\n\r\nD-Alanine aminotransferase annotations changed across a broad variety of organisms from D-Alanine aminotransferase to D-Alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.21)--only EC # was missing.  D-Alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.21) also occurs in Peptidoglycan biosynthesis with a matching annotation \r\n\r\nD-Serine deaminase (EC 4.3.1.18) was annotated across a variety of genomes that had it previously annotated as small protein involved in amino acid metabolism and had probability similarity with E.coli dsdA gene of <e^-100.  The gene was located in E.coli as dsdA at location b2366 and was called D-Serine deaminase.  FIG search of b2366 gave a result with Uniprot and NCBI labels as D-Serine dehydratase but given the reaction D-serine + H2O = pyruvate + NH3 + H2O and that fact that this PEG occurs in no other subsystem yet i think deaminase is more accurate\r\n\r\nUpon location of gene YDR111C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its definition as an alanine aminotransferase in KEGG its annotation was made--it had not previously been personally annotated--to a putative alanine transaminase (glutamyc pyruvic transaminase) (EC 2.6.1.2) which describes its role in teh reaction L-alanine + 2-oxoglutarate = pyruvate + L-glutamate a bit better than alanine aminotransferase.  This gene had not previously existed in other subsystems so it's annotation was carried across organisms with sequence e values of <E^-80.  Of note--several organisms have genes that are quite similar to this gene but are annotated as aspartate aminotransferase--a fact that is supported by NCBI and Uniprot.  Given the similarity in the two amino acids this is expected.  Nevertheless, very few organisms appear to actually possess the alanine version.  \r\n\r\nAny gene for 2.6.1.12 could not be found in any organism either through KEGG or in other subsystems of SEED.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, no genes could be found for the enzyme 5.1.1.10 in any organisms in either KEGG, ecocyc, SEED or the ERGO database\r\n\r\nThe gene AlaGAT (2.6.1.44) when it was first found in Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. marinus str. (evidence of presence of the gene gathered from KEGG) was frequently annotated as the enzyme that catalyzes the reactions serine+pyruvate = L-alanine + hydroxypyruvate as well as L-alanine + glyoxylate = pyruvate + glycine.  I found no corroborating evidence for the former reaction so in this subsystem only the latter is represented however, the functional annotations for the genes that mentioned both functions have been created as multi-functional genes with both.\r\n\r\nAlso Ala3OAT Omega-amino acid--pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.18)is highly similar to Adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.62) in multiple organisms and may need a change of annotation\r\n\r\nL-serine dehydratase is an alias of L-serine deaminase with the same EC number 4.3.1.17 \r\n\r\nThe reaction L-Alanine:2-oxo-acid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.12) catalyzes the reaction L-alanine + a 2-oxo acid = pyruvate + an L-amino acid  and should be included in this subsystem but no genes in any organism could be located for a sequence homology search\r\n\r\nThe reaction L-amino acid racemase (EC 5.1.1.10) catalyzes the general reaction L-Serine to D-Serine and in general alternates an L-amino acid with a D-amino acid.  No genes in any organisms could be found for this particular reaction but it should be included if found.\r\n\r\nAlaTA appears to be only in eukaryotic pathways\r\n"]},

        "description":"Enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductases (ENRs) catalyze the last step of the elongation cycle in the synthesis of fatty acids, namely, the reduction of a trans-2-acyl-ACP (an enoyl-ACP) to the fully saturated acyl-ACP species. The reductant is either NADH or NADPH, although in one case a reduced flavin (FMNH2) is used as an intermediate in the reduction (PMID: 19151923)\n\nENRs display an unusual diversity among organisms (unlike other enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis).  Selective emergence of different types of ENR could be due to the fact that a variety of both synthetic and natural antibacterial compounds are shown to specifically target their activity, e.g. triclosan and isoniazid (PMID: 27577999). See also Subsystem: \"Resistance to Triclosan\"\n\nSo far, four ENR isozymes have been characterized in bacteria in detail, namely FabI, FabL, FabV, and FabK (PMID:19151923). FabI and FabL ENRs are known to share a similar YX6K type catalytic domain, whereas FabV carry a YX8K type catalytic domain. All ENRs are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, except for FabK, which is completely TCS-refractory and is a non-SDR ENR (PMID:27577999)\n\nIn addition to the 4 prototypic ENR types, recent functional screening of the soil metagenome revealed that a variety of target ENR homologues are responsible for the TCS resistance (PMID: 27577999).  Diverse ENRs similar to 7-&#945;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7-&#945;-HSDH), FabG, or the unusual YX7K-type ENR conferred extreme tolerance to TCS. The TCS-refractory 7-&#945; HSDH-like ENR and the TCS-resistant YX7K-type ENR seem to be prevalent in human pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that a selective enrichment occurred in pathogenic bacteria in soil (PMID: 27577999). These additional types of ENR are included in this Subsystem as well, flagged as \"via_metagenomics\"\n\nReferences:\n\nCell Mol Life Sci. 2009 May;66(9):1507-17.

        "description":"Virulence factor production and the development of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to be regulated by two hierarchically organized quorum-sensing systems activated by two types of small acyl-homoserine lactone signal molecules (common in gram-negative bacteria): \n(i) N-(3-oxo-do-decanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, which is the signal of the las  quorum-sensing system; (ii) N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone,  which is the signal of the rhl quorum-sensing system  \n\nRecently, a third type of bacterial signal molecule, the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), has been identified, which positively regulates a subset of genes dependent on the quorum-sensing systems (Pesci et al., 1999; Bredenbruch et al., 2006).  The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is a 3-hydroxy-4-quinolone with a 2-alkyl substitution which is synthesized by the condensation of anthranilic acid with a 10-carbon 3-keto-fatty acid (Coleman et al., 2008). \n\nPQS is only one of a large class of these compounds [so called 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones (AHQs)].  In fact, P. aeruginosa produces over 50 different AHQs [Lepine et al., 2004].  Although biological functions of many of these are not  known, some were originally identified for their antibacterial properties.  This type of small signal molecules thus far appear to be synthesized only by P. aeruginosa and certain  Burkholderia species (Diggle et al., 2006).  PQS has been shown to control the expression of multiple virulence  factors in P. aeruginosa.  PQS acts  as a ligand for PqsR, the transcriptional activator which controls the pqsABCDE operon (Wade et al., 2005).\n\nDiggle et al., 2006 have shown that many species of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria contain putative pqs gene homologs.  However, apart from P. aeruginosa, only strains of the primary human pathogen  B. pseudomallei and the serologically and genetically related B. thailandensis were found to contain a complete,  putative pqsABCDE operon. \n\nInterestingly, neither B. pseudomallei nor B. thailandensis possess a  homolog of the P. aeruginosa pqsH gene. This gene facilitates the conversion of HHQ to PQS in P. aeruginosa,  and its absence from B. pseudomallei would suggest  that production of PQS was unlikely in this organism.  Indeed, the authors have shown that while none of the strains examined synthesized PQS, all produced HHQ [2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone];  B. thailandensis produced a range of AHQs; and at least one B. pseudomallei strain made  2-nonenyl-4(1H)-quinolone (NEHQ) (Diggle et al., 2006).  \n\nMutation of hhqA  in B. pseudomallei resulted in the loss of AHQ synthesis,  altered colony morphology, and enhanced elastase synthesis. Exogenous HHQ reduced elastase production in the B. pseudomallei hhqA mutant, consistent with a role for HHQ in cell-cell signaling. In addition, the B. pseudomallei hhqA and hhqE genes both complemented the corresponding P. aeruginosa pqsA and pqsE mutants, demonstrating that the genes required for AHQ synthesis and response are functionally conserved across the two genera, and that AHQ signaling is not restricted to P. aeruginosa (Diggle et al., 2006).\n",

        "description":"Many substrates enter the central carbon metabolism on the level of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) - including acetate, fatty acids, waxes, alcohols, alkanes, polyhydroxyalkanoates, etc. In aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria OXIDATION of acetyl-CoA proceeds via the citric acid cycle, while glyoxylate cycle (modification of the citric acid cycle bypassing the two decarboxylation steps) serves for the ASSIMILATION of acetyl-CoA (encoded in SS: Glyoxylate Bypass\"). Glyoxylate cycle enables the use of such substrates as sole carbon sources.  It�s two key enzymes are isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (Dixon and Kornberg, 1959)\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that glyoxylate cycle can not be the only solution for acetyl-CoA assimilation, because a number of organisms capable of growth with C2 compounds as sole carbon source, lack isocitrate lyase (ICL) activity, or show labeling pattern after growth on acetate inconsistent with the operation of the glyoxylate cycle (Erb et al., 2007 and refs therein).  These organisms include many purple nonsulfur bacteria, e.g. Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodospirillum rubrum (Ivanovsky et al., 1997), and other alpha-proteobacteria, like the methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens (Korotkova et al., 2002) and several aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs [inferred by genome sequence analysis (Alber etal., 2006)].  Also, streptomycetes use an alternate, isocitrate lyase-independent route for acetyl-CoA assimilation, and there appears to be a direct link to antibiotic biosynthesis in these organisms (Liu and Reynolds, 1999).  \r\n\r\nSeveral putative schemes for acetate assimilation by isocitrate-lyase-negative organisms have been proposed (Meister et al., 2005 and refs therein; see also Tab �Illustrations� above), but none have been elucidated completely.  For example -\r\n(1) for purple nonsulfur bacteria, e.g. Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodospirillum rubrum (Ivanovsky et al., 1997), \r\n(2) for methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens (Korotkova et al., 2002), \r\n(3) for streptomycetes (Liu and Reynolds, 1999).\r\n\r\nAn exciting and elegant work is under way in the labs of Brigit E. Alber and G. Fuchs: the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway of C2 assimilation that they proposed, although far from being completely understood, promises to explain metabolic transformations during growth on acetate in many (if not all) ICL-negative organisms (Meister et al., 2005; Alber et al., 2006; Erb etal., 2007; Zarzycki et al., 2008).  It apparently functions not only in acetyl-CoA assimilation.  For methylotrophic bacteria such as Methylobacterium extorquens, extension of the serine cycle with reactions of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway leads to a simplified scheme for ICL-independent C1 assimilation; in Chloro&#64258;exus aurantiacus it is involved in autotrophic CO2 &#64257;xation (Herter et al., 2002.  In Streptomyces sp. it may also supply precursors (ethylmalonyl-CoA) for antibiotic biosynthesis (Erb etal., 2007). It is currently being studied in detail in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 (see proposed scheme of this pathway under the \"Illustrations\" tab).\r\n\r\nCrotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase [catalyzing: crotonyl-CoA + CO2 + NADPH -> ethylmalonyl-CoA + NADP] was identi&#64257;ed as the key enzyme of this pathway.  In brief, the pathway consists of two parts.  In the first part two molecules of acetyl-CoA and one molecule CO2 are converted via acetoacetyl-CoA and ethylmalonyl-CoA to glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA. In the second part glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA are converted with another molecule of acetyl-CoA and CO2 to L-malyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA.  Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase  and Mesaconyl-CoA hydratase are diagnostic of the pathway presence.\r\n\r\nThis SS will be updated as the new details of this novel pathway will be become clear.

        "subsystem_id":"Methicillin_resistance_in_Staphylococci",
        "description":"Methicillin resistance in staphylococci is due to an acquired foreign penicillin-binding protein, PBP2-prime (PBP2a).  PBP2a belongs to the group of high-molecular-mass PBPs of class B1, a family of proteins containing a transpeptidase domain and a non-penicillin-binding domain of unknown function (Goffin and Ghuysen 1998).  They are characterized by very low affinity to beta-lactams,  allowing the strains to grow in the presence of drug concentrations sufficient to inactivate the PBP modules of all other multimodular PBPs.  PBP2a confers an intrinsic resistance to all beta-lactams and their derivatives.  PBP2a is a rather poor transpeptidase forming mainly muropeptide-dimers when all other PBPs are saturated with beta-lactams (de Jonge and Tomasz 1993) and seems to depend on the transglycosylase module of the resident PBP2 (Pinho et al., 2001) and PBP4 (Leski and Tomasz, 2005) to confer resistance, even though their transpeptidase activity is inhibited by methicillin.  \r\n\r\nThe PBP2a is encoded by mecA, located on a SCCmec element (=Staphylococcus Cassette Chromosome MEC) - a novel mobile element that resembles neither transposons nor bacteriophages, and could be described, in analogy to pathogenicity islands, as a �resistance island� (Hiramatsu et al. 2001).  It ranges in size between 21 and 67 kb and integrates into orfX, close to the origin of replication.\r\nTranscription of mecA can be regulated by two distinct, albeit analogous sets of regulatory genes.  One is the regulatory element mecR1-mecI, located upstream and divergently transcribed from mecA; the second is the homologous regulatory element blaR1-blaI of the staphylococcal penicillinase.  MecI and BlaI are repressors and can each repress mecA as well as blaZ transcription.  In contrast, MecR1 and BlaR1, the corresponding sensor-transducer molecules, are specific for their cognate repressors and cannot substitute for each other (McKinney et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nResistance levels in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) depend on efficient PBP2a production, and are modulated by auxiliary chromosomal factors, largely genes involved in the peptidoglycan precursor formation and turnover, regulation, transport, and signal transduction.  Auxiliary factors can modulate methicillin-resistance levels in a mecA-acquired strain from phenotypically susceptible to highly resistant.  The auxiliary factors that have been identified so far (largely by screening for the loss/reduction of methicillin resistance in insertion mutants generated by random transposon mutagenesis) are listed in this Subsystem � roughly in the order of their impact on methicillin resistance in Staphylococci (for a detailed review see ref. 1).  The majority of them are annotated as bi-funtional as follows: \r\n�___factor involved in methicillin resistance / actual catalytic function (if known)�\r\nPlease, follow the links in the Spreadsheet to the corresponding PEG pages to see complete annotations and links to relevant publications.  Known regulatory systems are included in this SS as well.\r\n\r\nThe global regulatory systems agr and sar also affect methicillin resistance (Duran et al. 1996), e.g. sigma-B, alternate sigma factor of S. aureus RNA polymerase, is required for the expression of high-level methicillin resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Wu et al., 1996) and S. epidermidis (Knobloch et al., 2005).  In summary, homogenous, high methicillin resistance requires sufficient expression of PBP2a, an optimal rate of peptidoglycan precursor formation, and a very specific peptidoglycan precursor structure. In addition, the control of autolytic activity, either directly or via the charge of cell wall polymers, appears to have an influence on resistance.\r\n",

        "description":"The proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is also called respiratory complex I, transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone via one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and up to nine iron-sulfur clusters.Respiratory chain Complex I or NADH:quinone oxidoreductase catalyzes oxidation of NADH in the mitochondrial matrix or bacterial cytoplasm and reduction of quinone in the membrane, coupled to pumping of 4H(+)/2e(-) across the membrane. The same enzyme complex is also capable of the reverse reaction, i.e. Deltamu(H(+))-supported NAD(+) reduction. \r\n A structural minimal form of complex I consisting of 14 (13 inE.coli)different subunits called NuoA to NuoN (or Nqo1 to Nqo14). The isolated Escherichia coli complex I can be split into a NADH dehydrogenase fragment, a connecting fragment, and a membrane fragment. The soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment represents the electron input part of the complex and consists of the subunits NuoE, F, and G.(Uhlmann, Friedrich,Biochemistry. 2005 Feb 8;44(5):1653-8.)The FMN and four iron-sulfur clusters have been detected in this fragment .Two EPR-detectable [4Fe-4S] clusters are bound to the NuoI in from Rhodobacter capsulatus. NuoB was shown to carry FeS cluster in E.coli. \r\nNuoB, NuoD, NuoC constitute connecting module of complex I. Role of NuoC is not studied well.\r\nNuoH subunit is seemingly involved in quinone binding (Roth, Hagerhall,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Apr 2;1504(2-3):352-62). NuoD, NuoB interface was also shown to be involvd in quinone binding (Prieur et al,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Apr 2;1504(2-3):173-8. )\r\n6-8 membrane  domain subunits considered to be involved in H(+)(Na(+)) translocation: NuoA, NuoL, NuoM, NuoN,NuoK, NuoJ, The Complex I enzyme has evolved from smaller functional building blocks. Three Complex I protein subunits, NuoL, NuoM and NuoN, show primary sequence similarity to one particular class of antiporters.Multisubunit antiporter complex is suposed to be recruited to the ancestral enzyme. It was also concluded that the last common ancestor of the Complex I enzyme family and membrane bound NiFe hydrogenases of type 3 and 4 contained the NuoKLMN subunit module.(Mathiesen, Hagerhall,FEBS Lett. 2003 Aug 14;549(1-3):7-13.)\r\nModule organisation of Complex I is reflected in engaging of its subuits and blocks of subunits in different protein complexes in many orgnisms. It is still unclear whether the cyanobacterial ndh gene products actually form a single large protein complex or exist as smaller independent complexes. For example, paralogs of Subunits 4 and 5 are involved in carboxysome CO2 uptake and NuoE homolog (HoxE), is part of the bidirectional hydrogenase in Cyanobacteria. (Schmitz et al, Biochim Biophys Acta. 2002 Apr 22;1554(1-2):66-74). We also noticed, that NUOE is a potential component of hydrogenase in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 [B](gene clustering evidence).\r\n\n",

Genes encoding the 3 subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase part of complex I are apparently missing in these species. The possibility was discussed that chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain a complex I equipped with a different electron input device. This complex may work as a NAD(P)H: or a ferredoxin:plastoquinone oxidoreductase participating in cyclic electron transport during photosynthesis (Friedrich et al,FEBS Lett. 1995 Jun 26;367(2):107-11.).Recently, two new Ndh subunits (slr1623 and sll1262 (Putative subunit of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (PS) in our subsystem) ) have been detected, that are unrelated to subunits in the eubacterial complex I but which have homologues to closely related chloroplast Ndh complex of maize (Funk, E., Schafer, E., and Steinmuller, K. (1999) J. Plant Physiol. 154, 16-23). The presence of these additional subunits might reflect the use by the NDH-1 and Ndh complexes of a different, so far unidentified, electron input module.(Prommeenate et al,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jul 2;279(27):28165-73.

        "description":"This subsystem encodes a proposed pathway for alkene biosynthesis from fatty acyl-CoAs (or -ACPs) that is based largely on enzyme activities homologous to those essential for fatty acid biosynthesis. The first step of alkene biosynthesis, could be decarboxylation of the &#946;-ketoacyl-CoA and nucleophilic attack by the resulting carbanion on an acyl-CoA to form an aliphatic diketone (decarboxylative Claisen condensation like FabH). Following formation of the aliphatic diketone, alkene biosynthesis could follow as a series of reductase and dehydratase reactions homologous to those catalyzed by &#946;-ketoacyl-ACP reductases (FabG), &#946;-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases (FabZ), and enoyl-ACP reductases (FabI). Genes designated as oleABCD encode this pathway. The heterologous expression of threse genes from M. luteus (Mlut_13230-13250) in a fatty acid-overproducing strain of E. coli resulted in production of long-chain alkenes, predominantly 27:3 and 29:3 (X:Y, where X = carbon number and Y = number of CC bonds).\r\nIn a different paper it was shown that the oleABCD genes are required for long-chain olefin production by S. oneidensis.

        "description":"Quoted from (Paredes-Sabja et al., 2008):  Bacillus and Clostridium species have the ability to form metabolically dormant spores that are extremely resistant to environmental stresses, such as heat, radiation, and toxic chemicals. However, dormant spores must first go through germination and then outgrowth to be converted to vegetative cells.  Spore germination has been studied most extensively for Bacillus subtilis and can be initiated by a variety of chemicals, including nutrients, cationic surfactants, and enzymes, as well as by hydrostatic pressure. Nutrient germinants for spores of Bacillus species include L-alanine, a mixture of L-asparagine, D-glucose, D-fructose, and potassium ions (AGFK), and inosine. These nutrient germinants interact with cognate receptors located in the inner spore membrane, stimulating the release of monovalent cations (H+, Na+, and K+), divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+), and the spore core�s large depot (~20% of core dry weight) of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid [DPA]), accompanied by an increase in the water content of the spore core. DPA is released as a 1:1 chelate with divalent cations, predominantly Ca2+ (Ca-DPA), and Ca-DPA release triggers further events in spore germination. Most important among the latter is the hydrolysis of the spore�s peptidoglycan cortex by one or more spore cortex lytic enzymes (SCLEs), which allows the core to expand and to take up even more water to the level found in growing cells. This event, in turn, restores protein movement and enzyme action in the spore core and leads to resumption of energy metabolism and macromolecular synthesis.  \r\n",

        "subsystem_id":"Biogenesis_of_c-type_cytochromes",
        "description":"Cytochromes of the c type bind heme covalently via two thioether bonds to the two cysteines within the sequence motif Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His located in the periplasmic domain of the cytochrome.  The mechanism of this covalent stereo-specific attachment of heme to the cysteine residues of apocytochrome is the key question of biogenesis of c-type cytochromes.  At least three different pathways of variable complexity have been described so far:\r\n\r\nSystem III of cytochrome c maturation, the simplest kind known, operates in mitochondia (mt) of fungi, vertebrates, invertebrates, and some green algae (i.e., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii).  It has been studied in detail in yeast.  A single enzyme, cytochrome c haem lyase (CCHL) is required for the formation of two thioether bonds.  However, in fungal (and possibly animal) mt two separate CCHLs are used for the two c-type cytochromes c and c1.   CCHL genes are nuclear encoded.\r\n\r\nSystem II is found in Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria and some proteobacteria, and also in plant and algal chloroplasts, and perhaps in archaea.  While the main components of the system II - proteins CcdA and Ccs1 are homologous across different species, protein thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases that are associated with CcdA (ResA in B. subtilis � Erlendsson et al., 2003) can be rather diverse in different organisms.  Based on co-localization of these proteins with CcdA (and Ccs1) they have been included in this SS as possibly involved in cyt c biogenesis (Hyp3, Hyp4).  Generally thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases (i) share an active site with two Cys residues arranged in a motif: C-X-X-C; (ii) despite very low primary sequence similarity often show the same tertiary structure � thioredoxin-like fold.\r\n\r\nSystem I cytochrome c maturation occurs in alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria, Deinococci, and mitochondria of plants and protozoa [1�3,13]. It requires eight or nine specific cytochrome c maturation (ccm) genes often located in a cluster, and three dsb genes (for disulfide bond formation). In addition, genes of the general secretion pathway and of cellular redox control contribute to efficient cytochrome C biogenesis.  System I pathway has a higher affinity for haem than system II for cytochrome c biogenesis due to the presence of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is required for release of the periplasmic haem chaperone CcmE to the last step of cytochrome c assembly (Feissner et al., 2006). This ABC transporter is composed of the ATP-binding subunit CcmA, and two membrane proteins, CcmB and CcmC. In the absence of CcmA or CcmB, holo(haem)CcmE binds to CcmC in a stable dead-end complex, indicating high affinity binding of haem to CcmC (Feissner et al., 2006).\r\n   CcmCDE are involved in heme delivery. CcmC is required for the covalent attachment of heme to the heme chaperone CcmE. CcmF has been proposed to form a bacterial cytochrome c heme lyase complex together with CcmH (and CcmL).  Cysteine thiols of the heme-binding motif of apocytochromes c are oxidized by the periplasmic DsbA. CcmG, a thioredoxin-like protein, and CcmH, a putative thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, reduce intramolecular disulfide bonds in apocytochromes before heme attachment by transferring electrons from the transmembrane disulfide oxidoreductase DsbD (DipZ) \r\n",

Systems II and III coexist in a small number of organisms (var.code 4): Bordetella bronchiseptica, B.parapertussis (but NOT in B.pertussis or B.avium); in Burkholderia fungorum and B.xenovorans (but NOT in Burkholderia cepacia, cenocepacia, or pseudomallei); in Ralstonia eutropha (but NOT R.solanacearum).  Recent acquisition of System I by horizontal transfer or its loss ?? \r\n\r\n2. In Xylella fastodiosa (but NOT in other Xylellas) a short form of Cytochrome c heme lyase subunit CcmH is present and co-localized with a protein annotated as �Hypothetical protein associated with short form of CcmH� (Hyp6).\r\n\r\n3. In some Clostridia (C.perfringens and C.difficile) a fused protein is present: \r\nCytochrome c-type biogenesis protein CcdA (DsbD analog) / Cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein ResA, but their homologs in C.thermocellum and C.tetani are NOT fused.  No cyt c biogenesis-related proteins can be identified in nonpathogenic Clostridium acetobutylicum. \r\n\r\n4. In all Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderia, Neisseria, etc) homologs of CcdA are absent while all other components of System II are present in a nice cluster.  Apparently, DsbD homologs (normally associated with System I) can substitute for CcdA function.  This assumption is based on the clustering of DsbD homologs with System II genes in some of these organisms and on (indirect) experimental data in Pseudomonas (Page et al., 1997) where a CcdA-like protein could substitute for part of the DsbD function.\r\n\r\nNote: \"Putative arylsulfate sulfotransferase\" is included in this SS only due to it's clustering with DsbA-like and DsbB-like proteins.

        "description":"The products of mixed acid fermentation are succinate, lactate, acetate, ethanol, formate, CO2 and H2 gas.  The route to succinate originates at the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP); all other compounds are derived from anaerobic dissimilation of pyruvate.  Product patters vary considerably, even in the same species, depending on a number of environmental factors, including the oxidation state of the carbon substrate, the extracellular oxidoreduction potential, and the pH of the external environment.  For example, the oxidation state dictates the amount of NADH to be recycled and therefore the composition of the excreted fermentation products. The oxidation of glucose (oxidation state 0) into two molecules of pyruvate produces two NADH molecules (4 reducing equivalents). A more reduced sugar alcohol (e.g., sorbitol; oxidation state -1) produces three NADH, while a highly oxidized sugar acid (e.g., glucuronic acid; oxidation state +2) yields no NADH.  Thus, to recycle the larger amount of NADH formed during growth on the more reduced sorbitol, cells must excrete more of the highly reduced ethanol (oxidation state -2). In contrast, cells growing on glucuronic acid are redox balanced and thus do not need to produce ethanol. Instead, they can convert more of their pyruvate to acetate (oxidation state 0). Each of fermentation branches accepts different amounts of reducing equivalents: succinate 4[H], ethanol 4[H], lactate 2[H], acetate 0[H], formate 0[H] (White, 2000). Pathways that utilize 4[H] per PEP/pyruvate molecule are particularly valuable, e.g. succinate branch (it is not encoded in this Subsystem, see SS: �TCA Cycle�).\n\nSimilarly, external pH influences the composition of excreted products. Near or above pH 7, the predominant products are acetate, ethanol, and formate, with moderate amounts of succinate. As the pH drops, cells produce lactate and formate (instead of acetate), converting formate to H2 and CO2 (Wolfe, 2005)\n\nPyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) is the key enzyme for mixed acid fermentation.  However, Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and even Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) (normally operational only under respiratory conditions) can be can be used for pyruvate cleavage in fermentation as well.  This was demonstrated, for example, for Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Oenococcus oeni (Wagner et al., 2005) and B. subtilis (Cruz Ramos et al., 2000).  Such cases are not reflected in this SS (impossible to predict from genome sequence alone)\n",
