        description : |
            The name of the set of signature k-mers to use for annotating the sequences in the angiosperm genome. The SEED project may release updated sets of signature k-mers, but the set that contains the signature k-mers computed via the PlantSEED project is Release 70.

        ui-name : |
            k-mer size
        description : |
            The length of k-mer to use when annotating plant transcripts. When a set of signature k-mers is computed, the computation is done at various k-mer lengths. By default we are using the signature k-mers of 8 amino acids in length.

    <p>The Annotate Primary Metabolism for an Angiosperm Genome method will functionally annotate sequences in an angiosperm genome. Here, the functions were curated as part of the PlantSEED project, and collated into the PlantSEED Subsystems ontology. The curated functions constitute plant primary metabolism, and as such, is assumed to be largely unchanged between angiosperms. The resulting annotated genome be reviewed and downloaded. It can also be used as an input to other KBase methods such as <a data-method-id="build_a_metabolic_model">Build Metabolic Model</a>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NB:</strong> The initial set of genomes used for PlantSEED constituted of five Eudicots and five Monocots, as such, the signature k-mers used to annotate the sequences here were trained on angiosperms. A user may use this method to annotate any genome from any domain of life, but if the genome is not that of a green plant, the results will be unreliable.</p>
